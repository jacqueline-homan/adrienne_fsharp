      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Tally and Grace are teenage sisters living on the outskirts of society, dragged from one no-hope town to the next by their fugitive father. When an explosion rips their lives apart, they flee separately to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girls had always imagined that beyond the remote regions lay another, brighter world: glamorous, promising, full of luck. But as each soon discovers, if you arrive there broke, homeless and alone, the city is a dangerous place â a place where commerce and surveillance rule, and undocumented people like themselves are confined to lifeâs shady margins. Now Tally and Grace must struggle to find each other â or just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrated by a cast of unforgettable characters, &lt;em&gt;Black Glass&lt;/em&gt; is the work of an exceptional new talent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;I blame Bill Gates. Some time in the 1980s, Microsoft got sick of all its software problems being called âbugsâ, and decided that they were really âissuesâ. This was like moving from the active voice to the passive: nobody was responsible, and there was nothing specific you could focus on. It was a spectacularly successful imposition of corporate doublethink, and it worked a treat. From then on, the word âissuesâ spread like a virus around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suited the times. Nobody had problems any more. I even remember, a day or two before the company went broke, a spokesperson describing Ansett as having âliquidity issuesâ. Now you canât move for issues: theyâre like house flies in spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sick people have âhealth issuesâ. Celebrity cokeheads have âdependency issuesâ. Corporate crooks have âregulatory issuesâ. Even wayward Aussie Rules full-forwards have âkicking issuesâ. Everybody with a problem has got âissues theyâve got to work throughâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isnât it interesting that, at a time when the planetâs situation is more dire than ever, and American hubris is fomenting more and more rabid Islamic terrorism, no one can cope with a spade being called a shovel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like the worse things get, the less we can cope with facing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dovetails neatly with the corporate softening of language in general. Iâm not talking about the problem of euphemisms (such as âletting goâ instead of âfiringâ), which have been around forever. It has more to do with the agendas of the real Big Brother: finding a way to make covert political tactics and ambitions sound acceptable. âClimate changeâ is a serious issue, for instance, but is not as much of an alarming problem as âglobal warmingâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with book publishing, you ask? Not a lot, directly. But I canât help thinking about it most days, as we look at piles of unsolicited submissions and manuscripts, most of them struggling to breathe life into a common language that has been systematically denuded of colour and movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for serious book-publishers isnât just the increasing incidence of time-poor readers, or competition from other media, or the attractions of other leisure activities. Itâs also the fact that weâre dependant on a staple product â the English language â thatâs being robbed of vitality by a Western culture thatâs had enough of reality. Except, of course, on television.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;If youâre reading this from outside Australia, I apologise from the start for being parochial and incomprehensible. If youâre reading this from within Australia, I apologise for my completely un-Australian thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFL semi-finals took place last weekend, and the big news seemed to be that that they resulted in the two remaining Victorian teams being eliminated. This led to dark mutterings about the need to restore the natural order, opposed by enlightened rejoinders â some from within the elevated ranks of those who have engineered this development â that all we are seeing is the national competition working, and that we should all get used to it. I happen to think this is self-serving bullshit, but itâs not my biggest concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most commentators seem to have missed is that the semi-finals merely re-affirmed the fact that the top four sides after 22 home-and-away games were indeed the top four sides in the competition. Theyâre now allowed to play each other for the premiership, while the bottom four in the âfinal eightâ, as theyâre called, are no longer required to report for duty. I donât know how many times this has happened in the last ten years or so, but it feels like it happens most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What nobody seems to want to talk about is that this result makes it obvious, again, that the âfinal eightâ is a farce. There are sixteen teams in the AFL, and every year half of them get to play in the finals. This means that aspirants only have to win 12 games â they only have to win one more game than they lose throughout the season â to make the finals. Is there any elite sporting competition in the world which basks in such mediocrity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, there was a âfinal fourâ in a 12-club competition. That made sense logistically, and felt about right. But it didnât last long once commercial interests took hold. Once the four started being stretched to five and then six, the game was up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you wonât get any discussion about this in the media (especially in the TV networks that cover the sport). You wonât hear or read of footy fans complaining about it. None of the clubs are against it. And the AFL commission â they just love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs a virtuous circle: everybodyâs happy. Just think about the benefits: the fans get to daydream about their side making the finals well into each season; the networks get to attract advertising for games that would be dead rubbers; the sponsors get extra mileage; the radio stations and the press get to talk and speculate endlessly about the importance of each game every round; the ground managers get to fill their stadiums; the clubs get to sell more membership tickets during the year and to offer hope every new season; and the AFL gets a fortune for broadcasting rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereâs also the small matter of extra finals, each with large-to-massive attendances, having to be played each year. And several of them get played in the late afternoon or evening, when the dew makes the ground slippery and conditions are often tough for the players, but thereâs a prime-time TV audience watching all around the country. (And thereâs continuous pressure from TV for the grand final to be played at night â what a lip-smacking advertising bonanza that would be.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is win-win-win, a beautiful, triple bottom-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only trouble is, itâs a carefully confected bit of fairy floss. Whatâs worse, it feels like the worst parts of the Australian character coming together: a ruthless pursuit of material gain; a dumbing down of values and principles; a worship of ordinariness; and a triumph for patronising managerialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs emblematic of a culture that is self-satisfied and loves equalising downwards; in sport, it loves talking itself up as world-class, but wonât do anything hard that promotes excellence. Think what a revolutionary symbol it would be if the AFL made the finals a contest reserved for the best of the best â and not the best of the rest. It ainât gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The âfinal eightâ is a perfect, victimless crime. And no one cares about it, except for cranky individuals like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same factors are at work behind the scenes of the national competition. The biggest motivation behind this concoction is the pursuit of national markets for the code and for its partners in crime. As part of this, the AFL rigs the rules so that no side can stay at the top (or will languish at the bottom) for very long. This reinforces all the commercial advantages of having a âfinal eightâ. Again, no one complains, because they all benefit from it. Even the clubs â the most likely âstakeholdersâ to complain â are bought off with financial bailouts and generous distributions of advertising funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFL has constructed a remarkable hybrid: a socialist, heavily regulated competition delivered to an arch-capitalist marketplace. Strangely enough, this has been modelled on the USâs National Football League. Funny how âfree tradeâ goes out the window when there are higher matters at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the lagging Victorian sides. This is not an accident of history; it is the direct result of the structure of the competition. With Melbourneâs grounds having been rationalised to the MCG and the atrociously surfaced Telstra Dome, each interstate side now has a substantial home-ground advantage: it gets to play at home for half its games, and its Victorian visitors suffer the known disadvantages of interstate travel. (The interstate teams have to travel as well, of course, but their away record is much better â maybe practice makes perfect.) Meantime, back in Victoria, the only ground that confers a home-ground advantage is Geelongâs, and theyâre often not good enough to get the benefit of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well, thereâs now a paradoxical reversion to tribalism â the basis of the original VFL â which also favours the interstate sides. They recruit a higher proportion of their players locally than do the Victorian sides, and their fans relate emotionally to those sides, just like the non-national good-old-days of the suburban VFL. With only one side in Brisbane and Sydney, and two each in Adelaide and Perth, this is completely understandable â and unbeatable. In the meantime, the Victorian teams are becoming more like brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I donât expect any of this to change in the foreseeable future. In fact, when the AFL adds a couple more interstate sides over the next several years, Iâm sure thereâll be pressure for a âfinal tenâ. After that, I reckon, thereâll be a really revolutionary idea: a finals series in which everybody gets another chance. Theyâll probably call it the AFL Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(And thereâs continuous pressure from TV for the grand final to be played at night â what a lip-smacking advertising bonanza that would be.)

This is win-win-win, a beautiful, triple bottom-line.

The only trouble is, itâs a carefully confected bit of fairy floss. Whatâs worse, it feels like the worst parts of the Australian character coming together: a ruthless pursuit of material gain; a dumbing down of values and principles; a worship of ordinariness; and a triumph for patronising managerialism.

Itâs emblematic of a culture that is self-satisfied and loves equalising downwards; in sport, it loves talking itself up as world-class, but wonât do anything hard that promotes excellence. Think what a revolutionary symbol it would be if the AFL made the finals a contest reserved for the best of the best â and not the best of the rest. It ainât gonna happen.

The âfinal eightâ is a perfect, victimless crime. And no one cares about it, except for cranky individuals like me.

The same factors are at work behind the scenes of the national competition. The biggest motivation behind this concoction is the pursuit of national markets for the code and for its partners in crime. As part of this, the AFL rigs the rules so that no side can stay at the top (or will languish at the bottom) for very long. This reinforces all the commercial advantages of having a âfinal eightâ. Again, no one complains, because they all benefit from it. Even the clubs â the most likely âstakeholdersâ to complain â are bought off with financial bailouts and generous distributions of advertising funds. 

The AFL has constructed a remarkable hybrid: a socialist, heavily regulated competition delivered to an arch-capitalist marketplace. Strangely enough, this has been modelled on the USâs National Football League. Funny how âfree tradeâ goes out the window when there are higher matters at stake. 

Which brings us back to the lagging Victorian sides. This is not an accident of history; it is the direct result of the structure of the competition. With Melbourneâs grounds having been rationalised to the MCG and the atrociously surfaced Telstra Dome, each interstate side now has a substantial home-ground advantage: it gets to play at home for half its games, and its Victorian visitors suffer the known disadvantages of interstate travel. (The interstate teams have to travel as well, of course, but their away record is much better â maybe practice makes perfect.) Meantime, back in Victoria, the only ground that confers a home-ground advantage is Geelongâs, and theyâre often not good enough to get the benefit of it. 

As well, thereâs now a paradoxical reversion to tribalism â the basis of the original VFL â which also favours the interstate sides. They recruit a higher proportion of their players locally than do the Victorian sides, and their fans relate emotionally to those sides, just like the non-national good-old-days of the suburban VFL. With only one side in Brisbane and Sydney, and two each in Adelaide and Perth, this is completely understandable â and unbeatable. In the meantime, the Victorian teams are becoming more like brands.

I donât expect any of this to change in the foreseeable future. In fact, when the AFL adds a couple more interstate sides over the next several years, Iâm sure thereâll be pressure for a âfinal tenâ. After that, I reckon, thereâll be a really revolutionary idea: a finals series in which everybody gets another chance. Theyâll probably call it the AFL Cup.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;If visitors to this website care to click on the title page for &lt;a href="/book/equinox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equinox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; theyâll get an audio-visual introduction to a book that has a fascinating pre-publication history. The bottom line, as it were, is that rights to this book were sold to around 25 territories prior to publication, often for record sums, by the authorâs UK agency, Blake Friedmann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about &lt;a href="/book/equinox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equinox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the 2005 Frankfurt Book Fair in quite strange circumstances. I had turned up for a meeting with the authorâs agent, at which I was promptly offered a glass of champagne. This was a very unusual start to business-as-usual, and I didnât think it was just because they were thrilled to see me; so, being mildly inquisitive, I asked what the celebration was about. I was told that they were selling a book for record sums at the fair to European publishers, with auctions for even more territories also under way. I asked about the book, and they told me it was a thriller. Being a competitive animal (and obviously knowing nothing about the book), I immediately asked whether theyâd consider splitting ANZ rights. They seemed surprised by this suggestion, but the agent I was talking to said it was possible, and then dug about in her folders and dragged out what I think was their last A5 reading copy for me to take away with me. This copy contained the first half or so of the manuscript (the balance was meant to be finished by the following January).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went on with my meeting, and for the time being thought nothing more of &lt;a href="/book/equinox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equinox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I think I assumed that, if it was sold to an Australian publisher, it would go to a multinational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Frankfurt, I had a break in Italy for a week or so, and chanced upon a copy of Dan Brownâs &lt;em&gt;Angels And Demons&lt;/em&gt; in the hotel we were staying at. I had never intended to read any Dan Brown, ever, but I felt drawn to doing so this time. To my astonishment, I thought the book was well written, intelligent, and well done. Then I thought Iâd better read the &lt;a href="/book/equinox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equinox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; manuscript. I did so, and felt the same things Iâd felt upon reading the Dan Brown: it was not even vaguely the kind of book I would normally read, but it was very hard to put down (in both senses). Strangely enough, that was what Iâd felt in 1999 when I read the first sample chapter of the manuscript that became &lt;em&gt;Shantaram&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got back to Australia I had a lot of post-Frankfurt things to do, and some time passed before I thought seriously about &lt;em&gt;Equinox&lt;/em&gt; again. I assumed that the ANZ rights must have already been sold, so I asked the agent tentatively what the story was. When I was told that rights were still available, I was astonished. I quickly made an offer, and then found myself in an auction. I won the auction with a bid of $40,000, against â I later learned â HarperCollins. This was either a very good or a very bad thing, depending on your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was yet a further twist to the story. When I was first given the reading copy in Frankfurt, the authorâs name was pseudonymous, and there was no mention of an Australian connection. It was only later, back in Australia when I enquired about the availability of rights, that Michael Whiteâs name and identity were revealed to me â and the fact that he was now an Australian resident (and citizen). This concentrated my attention considerably: all of a sudden, we had the prospect of publishing a well-known author, living in Australia, who weâd be able to tour and promote. Without knowing of these prospective benefits I may not have bid at all â and I certainly wouldnât have bid as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we brought Michael over to the Pan Macmillan winter sales conference, I started talking to selected media about him months in advance of publication, and we produced over 10,000 chapter samplers for the trade. None of this would have happened if heâd been a foreign, first-time author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect &lt;em&gt;Equinox&lt;/em&gt; to do very well â so well that our initial print-run is 12,000 copies. Itâs our lead title for the year, and weâre throwing the kitchen sink at it. I suspect that it will appeal to readers of thrillers in general, and Dan Brown fans in particular â especially given my own experience. And Iâve since learned that Michael is a friend of Danâs. So the auguries are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing: Iâve been amazed by the number of people whoâve been excited to hear that Michael used to be a member of a UK band called the Thompson Twins. Iâd never heard of them. In fact, the only thing I can remember about pop music in the 1980s is that most of it was crap. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;For me, this year&amp;rsquo;s Frankfurt Book Fair started and ended with Cate Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, however, I misplaced my voice somewhere between the airport and my hotel, and was never to find it again for the duration. By day one, I sounded like Donald Duck, had a full-blown cold, and had over 60 appointments to deal with. Somehow, it was all right on the night. At one stage I found myself apologising for the thin timbre of my speech, only to hear an equally surreal rasping noise reassure me that my interlocutor had the same problem. The Frankfurt Flu, as it&amp;rsquo;s often known, tends to afflict about a third of participants by fair&amp;rsquo;s end each year. It seems to be due to a combination of long-haul air travel and breathing in each other&amp;rsquo;s air in vast caverns at the fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Frankfurt, it is an enormous set of halls housing publishers and agents from around the world who get together to try to buy and sell rights to their books. There are also publishing suppliers touting their services. Agents and publishers get together at a succession of half-hour meetings that can last from nine in the morning to six o'clock at night. And there&amp;rsquo;s drinks at various bars, dinners and drinks, and drinks and drinks later at night for those who have the stamina and networking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had interesting talks (believe it or not) with a few old friends and new ones, incuding a fascinating perambulation with my fellow blogger, Richard Charkin, the head of Macmillan UK. Richard is extremely gloomy about the state and fate of the UK book trade, and is particularly doleful about the prospects of large publishers like his. Later on, though, my old friend Andrew Franklin, the brilliant owner of the UK&amp;rsquo;s Profile Books (and small publisher of the year for the third time), was positively bubbling with enthusiasm, and claimed that publishers always complain, that the UK economy was doing well, and that the UK book trade was quite OK. (Andrew had just received an order from Tesco for 20,000 copies of one his titles, which may have affected his mood somewhat.) It struck me, once again, that success makes an agile independent trade-publisher feel more satisfaction with the state of publishing than heavyweights often do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to Cate Kennedy. On the eve of the fair, we sold North American rights in a two-book deal (her short-story collection, &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/darkroots"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Roots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a novel that Cate has just started working on) to Elisabeth Schmitz at Grove/Atlantic. Elisabeth is highly regarded within the world of fiction publishing, and her judgement and enthusiasm carries great weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, on the first day of the fair, I sold UK &amp;amp; Commonwealth rights to Toby Mundy at Atlantic Books in London. And, suddenly, everyone I met seemed to be talking about or wanting to know about &amp;lsquo;the wonderful Australian writer, Cate Kennedy&amp;rsquo;.  I gave copies to several European publishers, was asked to send copies by several others, and kept being congratulated on publishing Cate. I know that Elisabeth and Grove&amp;rsquo;s owner, Morgan Entrekin, was spreading the word around the fair &amp;ndash; even though they derived no financial benefit by doing so. In fact, when I met Morgan at the very end of the fair, he was sitting and talking to an excellent  Danish publisher, praising Cate&amp;rsquo;s work. As it happened, I&amp;rsquo;d just met with our Scandinavian agents, so I was able to tell him where to get a reading copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generosity of spirit of Elisabeth and Morgan, and other publishers I met, kept me going when my voice and energy levels were hard to discern. In fact, I was struck by how much fellow-feeling there is amongst quality independent publishers around the world. They know each other, trust each other&amp;rsquo;s judgements, and are unstinting in their enthusiasm for each other&amp;rsquo;s work. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wonderful experience to be accepted in this fellowship, and I think it will be a great help to our authors as time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, one good turn deserves another. This year, like last year, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist buying a book from one of US publishing&amp;rsquo;s great men &amp;ndash; Peter Mayer. Peter, who used to run US Penguin, is the owner of The Overlook Press in the States and Duckworth in the UK. In fact, I bought more than one book from him: &lt;em&gt;Christopher&amp;rsquo;s Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;, the next novel by Charles McCarry, the US&amp;rsquo;s great spy-thriller writer (along with some of his best backlist titles), and an amazing spoof/hoax title called &lt;em&gt;The Art of Funerary Violin&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; a kind of &lt;em&gt;Molvania&lt;/em&gt; of violin history that was front-page news at the fair, and was reported on in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few weeks, proposals, manuscripts, and finished books will be pouring into our office for possible acquistion by us. And we&amp;rsquo;ll be sending the same kinds of materials to agents and publishers interested in our authors' works. That&amp;rsquo;s Frankfurt. A little bit of selling, and a little bit of buying. And a few frankfurts. And a few drinks. Frenzy, friendships, and flu. If I can just find my voice, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it all again next year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;A very unusual publishing-related event took place recently in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain its significance, a little history is needed. In 1980, Scribe published three books: &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/buckleyshope"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buckleyâs Hope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Craig Robertson (a fictional recreation of an epic encounter between white and black, before and then during the European foundation of Victoria; &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/comespring"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come Spring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Maria Lewitt (the first piece of Holocaust literature to be published in Australia, written as what we dubbed an âautobiographical novelâ; and &lt;em&gt;The Murders at Hanging Rock&lt;/em&gt; by Yvonne Rousseau (a series of individually plausible but mutually contradictory hypotheses about what might have happened within the fictional world of Joan Lindsayâs &lt;em&gt;Picnic at Hanging Rock&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two titles are still in print (which is almost miraculous in publishing terms), and on Sunday, 12 November 2006 the author of the first book finally realised his long-held desire to organise an anniversary celebration of the publication of his book. In truth, it was originally meant to have been a 25th anniversary celebration last year, in December 2005, but it had been slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About sixty people turned up to what turned out to be a significant event, held at the Trades Hall bar in Carlton. The author, Craig Roberston, spoke about the background to the book (see his speech, below); I spoke about my sense of the bookâs importance; Barry Hill also spoke about the Buckley story, and read three poems from his work &lt;em&gt;Ghosting William Buckley&lt;/em&gt;; Jan Wosititzky performed an extract from his current show, The Go-Between: William Murrangurk Buckley; and Gregory and Julitha, a duo from Victoriaâs surf coast, sang their own songs about Buckley, and finished with Janâs âBarrawornâ song from his show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a special feeling in the room, because everyone knew that they were celebrating something intrinsically important. It wasnât just the William Buckley story, but the undeniable fact that, by writing &lt;em&gt;Buckleyâs Hope&lt;/em&gt;, Craig single-handedly had rescued Buckley from obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the anniversary afternoon was a snapshot of the way in which his book has stimulated an outpouring of artistic responses in forms as various as poetry, painting, writing, and drama. But the Buckley tale has never âtakenâ in the wider culture the way it should have, probably because itâs an account of a white man who went native for 32 years. A film option has been taken out, so maybe thereâs still hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The William Buckley story should be taught to every school child. In the meantime, I have vowed that, at least while I&amp;rsquo;m running the company, it will never go out of print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>A very unusual publishing-related event took place recently in Melbourne.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;I hate Christmas. Let me rephrase that: I love Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole book trade lives and dies by the results of the three months-or-so before Christmas. If publishers and booksellers donât make money in this period, they donât make it for the whole year. Whatever doesnât sell then, never does; and even what apparently sells comes back in returns from booksellers over the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to add to everybodyâs anxiety levels over the stakes involved, Christmas as a retail activity seems to be happening later each year. This can make the suspense, difficult to deal with at the best of times, hard to bear. That so much should hang on so little, over such a short period of time, is awful; that such crass concerns should be held hostage to what should be a celebration of family values, human decency, and religious beliefs is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, publishersâ lists reflect this reality. All large publishers hold back their best titles for the pre-Christmas period â a time when weekly turnover in bookshops far exceeds their sales in any given week of the first six months of the year. This is even after allowing for mini-seasonal peaks such as Motherâs Day, Anzac Day, and Fatherâs Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bookshops sometimes complain about this behaviour by publishers (arguing that more and better books should be published earlier in the year), but the truth is that itâs rational behaviour by them. Any large publisher who puts out too many big books between January and June is at grave risk of doing both her authors and her publishing company a significant disservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, any publisher who releases a serious book between November and December is likely to regret the decision. The seasonal avalanche of celebrity bios, blockbusters, brand-name authors, summer reads, and sports books crushes everything in its path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thatâs why I feel deeply conflicted about Christmas (itâs not just because Iâm a deracinated Jewish atheist, in case you wondered). The way that Christmas forces us to skew our publishing programme always makes me fret. Weâre obliged to publish many of our good books at a time when bookshop activity is relatively light, and then weâre forced to subtly change the nature of our list and to get out of the way of the gorillas when activity surges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, our sales figures tend to be more evenly distributed than those of our larger peers. We have fewer bestsellers, but a relatively more reliable spread of sales over the year. We published our biggest-selling new title of the year in May â &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thelongestdecade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Longest Decade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by George Megalogenis. Among other notable titles (in terms of awards and/or sales) that we released in the first half of the calendar year have been &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/asbestoshouse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asbestos House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Gideon Haigh (February); &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/goodhealthinthe21stcentury"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Health in the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Dr Carole Hungerford (April); and &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/fearandpolitics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear and Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Carmen Lawrence (June).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our version of a commercial Christmas book is almost laughable by comparison with the big boysâ output: to take this year as an example, weâve produced a couple of cartoon books: &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/bestaustralianpoliticalcartoons2006"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Australian Political Cartoons 2006&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, edited by Russ Radcliffe, and &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/makecakesnotwar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make Cakes Not War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Judy Horacek; the paperback edition of Julian Burnsideâs &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/wordwatchingrevedn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordwatching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thescienceofhappiness"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Science of Happiness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Stefan Klein. (Iâm happy to add that all four titles are selling well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to test conventional understanding, we also published &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/insidetheglobajihad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside the Global Jihad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Omar Nasiri, in late November â apparently successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point (or the trouble, depending on your point of view) is that we canât bring ourselves to trash our own brand. Weâve learned from bitter experience that weâre incapable of publishing books cynically and well, and that if we have to meet the market we must do it on our terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So weâre going to keep publishing good books over the whole year â and, if I say so myself, 2007 is looking like the best publishing list weâve ever had â and weâre going to keep assuming that intelligent readers donât disappear in November and December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astute readers will notice that this stance is a combination of principle and pragmatism. What can I say? Itâs the Christmas season, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Tim Flannery has just been named Australian of the Year by the official body established to perform this task â and an excellent choice it was. Dr Flannery has done an invaluable job in alerting people around the world to the threat of global warming; and his book on the subject, &lt;em&gt;The Weather Makers&lt;/em&gt;, has been a deservedly huge success for Michael Heyward at Text and the publishers around the world to whom he sold the rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for my money, David Hicks is our alternative Australian of the Year. Hicks has put up with five years of torture and persecution at Guantanamo Bay, courtesy of his own governmentâs indifference and its craven subservience to its US master. Imprisoned for years without a charge, oppressed without a qualm, he has been a living symbol of post-9/11 &lt;em&gt;realpolitik&lt;/em&gt;. With almost no help from outside, and against the massive power of the US state, he has endured. So far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It originally took two-and-a-half years for Hicks to be charged, after heâd been caught in Afghanistan in December 2001. His alleged crimes: conspiracy, attempted murder, and aiding the enemy. The US claimed that heâd trained in al-Qaeda camps, guarded a Taliban tank at Kandahar airport, and travelled to Konduz in northern Afghanistan to join Taliban forces engaged in combat against US-led forces. They said he intended to kill coalition combatants in Afghanistan between September and December 2001, and that he aided al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the context of an armed conflict with the United States. Other reports have indicated that Hicks is anti-Semitic â which, to me, as the son of Holocaust survivors, is particularly offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if Hicks did indeed think or do any or all of these things, Iâd say he was a dickhead or a ratbag at best, and a vicious little bastard at worst. But what are we really talking about? Anybody who signed up to support the Taliban is a lunatic, but so what? Thereâs a lot of nasty intent asserted here, but no violent action. And it should be noted that none of this alleged behaviour was illegal in Australia at the time. Yet even these relatively modest charges (for someone who was deemed to be amongst âthe worst of the worstâ held at Guantanamo) had, of course, to be abandoned under the since-discredited military commission process. And any replacement charges that Hicks faces will still rely on evidence that was gathered under torture, and will be laid under a modified process that has few of the safeguards that Australians associate with âa fair goâ. And then the new process will presumably be subject to constitutional challenge as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it has gone on, year after year. Throughout his living hell â the solitary confinement, the interrogations, the long imprisonment, the denial of hope and contact with the outside world â Hicksâ own government has behaved with unspeakable indecency. For most of the time, theyâve ignored him. Some of the time, theyâve defamed him. And lately, as a public campaign to have him either treated decently or repatriated has got under way, the government has tried to act as though it cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime minister, John Howard, has pretended that heâs given the Americans a deadline to charge Hicks (without explaining what the âor elseâ implied in his âthreatâ might be, and only after the Yanks told him theyâd beat the date). Alexander Downer, the most undeservedly self-satisfied foreign minister in Australiaâs history, recently went out of his way to claim that Hicksâ mental state was fine (and then had the gall to be irritated because people were appalled to hear that his unacknowledged source was a US consular official whoâd spent a few minutes in Hicksâ company without talking to him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that Hicksâ treatment is unconscionable by any standards â whether youâre a conservative who believes in due process and the rule of law, or a liberal who believes that torture is unacceptable in any situation. Hicks may have been mad, bad, and dangerous to know, but nothing that he is alleged to have done or thought or said could justify what has been done to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough is enough. The long delays, the psychological and physical torture, and the tainted process have all added up to an intolerable situation that can only be remedied by Hicks being sent home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Hicks looks better as the Australian governmentâs treatment of him looks worse; thatâs what happens when you abandon principle and decency for a higher political cause. The result is that powerless, voiceless David Hicks has proven he is a genuine little Aussie battler (and not the ersatz kind that the Australian government pretends to represent). If Howard wants a martyr to a lost USâAustralia cause, heâs going about it the right way. In the meantime, we should all drink to the alternative Australian of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Disgusting, disgraceful, despicable â you pick the adjective you want to use about John Howard and his government. Personally, Iâd use all three, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Mr Howard was reported as saying he didnât detect a mood in the electorate to change the government. Iâve got news for him: whether thatâs right or not, thereâs a mood to get rid of him. Personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for very good reason. This is the mild-mannered gentleman whoâs made an artform of lying through his teeth throughout his political career. Look at just the highlights of his litany of deceit: core and ânon-coreâ promises (announced after heâd won an election); the children overboardâ who werenât (and whose refugee parents have never been apologised to); the âweapons of mass destructionâ that didnât exist, and a war we signed up for that we should never have gone near; and the abandonment of David Hicks to the tender mercies of the US army, only to have the damp squib of a single, pathetic, retrospective charge being proffered against Hicks after heâs endured five years of hell [for my view on the Hicksâ case, see my previous blog].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereâs also the small matter of global warming that Howard never believed in, but is suddenly keen to be seen to be doing something about, now that everybody else is worried about it. Typically, his solution is the catastrophic one of nuclear energy â a nice political squeeze on the opposition, but a disaster for us all if we ever went down that path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the politician and, latterly, the prime minister, whoâs been wrong on every major problem heâs had to decide about. He was wrong on Vietnam (and still is); he was obdurately opposed to putting pressure on the apartheid policies of the South African government; he opposed Asian immigration to Australia; he refused to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol; and, infamously, he committed Australia to the war in Iraq for bogus reasons. Even his supposed support for the independence of East Timor was not what he intended at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the prime minister for whom no policy backflip is too strenuous if it serves his partisan political purposes. This is the prime minister whoâs waged a relentless, Nixonian war on his perceived enemies and opponents in the media, the ABC, the universities, and community organisations. This is the prime minister who, for his own hidebound reasons and in his typical deceptive way, has made every working Australian anxious about their â and their childrenâs â wages and conditions, This is the prime minister who forgets no slight and tolerates no dissent within his own party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How ironic that this quintessential social conservative should so betray classic conservative values. The party that once stood for the liberty of the individual, the rule of law, due process, federalism, and the importance of continuity has now been laid waste by Howard and his cronies. Howard now presides over a political fiefdom that rewards servility and punishes opposition. He and his News Limited cheer squad stigmatise and sneer at all those who disagree with him â no matter how principled they are â and no matter how much his stance trashes traditional Liberal values. No instance better exemplifies this hubris than his â and his ministersâ â appalling handling of the David Hicks case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lately thereâs been the small matter of the Kevin Rudd problem. For the first time in his prime ministership, Howard faces a leader of the opposition whoâs energetic, disciplined, calm, decent, and smarter than him. Rudd also happens to be conservative, Christian, and ambitious â which is a difficult trio of core attributes to smear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate result has been a significant lift in Laborâs poll results and prospects, and in Ruddâs personal standing. I think what this is telling us is that the electorate has been waiting for an ALP leader they can trust and believe in, so they can finally do what theyâve wanted to do for years â get rid of Howard. The odd thing about this politically is that itâs purely personal: a significant majority of the community canât stand Howard. I suspect they would support a Liberal Party with a more centrist, honest leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howardâs response to this serious threat has been classic: heâs been rattled by the competition, and then had to resort to focus-group polling to aver that Rudd is âa bit full of himselfâ. Then, when news broke of Ruddâs meetings with the disgraced ex-con and former premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, he set loose his bovver-boy and heir-apparent, Peter Costello. The treasurer, who loves a stoush, has gone in boots-and-all. âAnyone who deals with Mr Brian Burke is morally and politically compromisedâ, Costello thundered in parliament on Thursday. Two days later, Costelloâs over-the-top vaudeville act had caused collateral damage to his own side: the erstwhile human services minister, Ian Campbell, had to resign after admitting that heâd met Burke in his (Campbellâs) office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rudd, in the meantime, has admitted an error of judgment, has been straightforward about it, and has stayed calm. This latter quality is like pure gold, and I sense that it is this feature above others that gives electors the confidence to feel that they can trust him to act reasonably on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Mr Howard, he has besmirched his office, reduced his party to a shell of its former self, and made ordinary Australians feel bad about their own country. To put it mildly, he has overstayed his welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Oliver Cromwell said to the rump parliament in April 1653, âYou have been sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of god, go!â&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;If youâre a regular visitor to our website, youâve probably noticed a recently introduced new feature on our home page, headed âRecent Bestsellersâ. When you click on this tab, youâre presented with a list of our previous monthâs top-12 bestselling titles, listed in order of their sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a thoughtful or inquisitive visitor, you may have wondered what the word âbestsellerâ means in this context. The answer, it turns out, is that âit dependsâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hasten to say that it doesnât depend on whimsy or wishful thinking or my subjective judgement. It depends on what you and I understand by the word âsalesâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain. First of all, this is what the list isnât based on. It doesnât include any sales we make outside Australia (for instance, in New Zealand), as that would distort the picture weâre aiming to present of our domestic sales rankings. And it doesnât include direct sales weâve made to organisations, authors, or individuals, as that would distort the figures for sales that have occurred in the book trade (which are known as âtrade salesâ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly â and perhaps surprisingly for many readers â the list isnât based on the number of copies of our books that weâve âsoldâ to bookshops. Thatâs because these arenât âsalesâ in the sense understood by ordinary people. These are, rather, invoices for books ordered by bookshops in the hope/expectation that theyâll sell them to the punters who wander into their stores. Any books that arenât sold are eventually returned (bookshops have to keep them for three months, and usually have up to a year after publication to return them), and the shops are then credited for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, a shop that orders six copies of a new title in March may return three copies in July and one copy the following February, and our initial apparent sale of six becomes a real sale of two. The trouble is, we donât know in March what our real sales will eventually turn out to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, we didnât know until Bookscan came into existence. Bookscan is a private company that tracks trade sales for its subscribers. These are real, weekly, through-the-till sales â not pretend sales, not subject-to-return sales, but bye-bye, have-a-good-life sales. We started subscribing to Bookscan on 1 January 2007, so we now know our real sales. And thatâs what our âbestellersâ listâ is based on: each monthâs sales as reported by Bookscan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of story, you might think. I wish it were. The trouble is, Bookscan doesnât have complete coverage of the book trade: itâs very accurate for large groups (such as Big W) and the chains (such as Angus &amp;amp; Roberston), but it misses out completely on airport bookstores through Newslink outlets (a situation which Iâve heard may soon change), and only has about 25 per cent coverage of the independent bookselling sector. Unfortunately, this sector is where independent publishers like us have their heartland, and where we sell a disproportionately high percentage of our books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the people behind Bookscan are not stupid, so they deal with the gaps by making allowances for them. This means their âsalesâ figures are guesstimates, but theyâre meant to be highly accurate guesstimates. Booksellers rely on them to keep a check on whatâs selling around the country (and whatâs not), so itâs a great help to them in making decisions about what to order and re-order. This has been a controversial effect, as itâs led to booksellers reducing their initial orders (and risks), and adopting more of a wait-and-see policy with new releases. This lowers the aggregate initial order for a new title, making it harder for publishers to meet their initial budgets, and anxious about meeting them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishers, especially the large ones (who get a comprehensive and sophisticated range of data), also rely on Bookscan to see what titles and genres are selling, where theyâre selling, and how their competitors are doing. They also rely on Bookscan to judge whether to reprint successful titles, and to help them decide how many to reprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where we come to the final twist in the âsalesâ tale. In the short time Iâve been using Bookscan, Iâve found it frankly useless as an aid to decision-making about reprints. At this point, a case-study is necessary to demonstrate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example I have in mind concerns &lt;a href="http://www.website.com"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ghost Plane&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Grey, a superb book that we published on 19 February. (This title is no. 2 on our March bestsellersâ list.) We printed a relatively modest quantity of 2500 copies, as I knew it would be a difficult book to sell with a non-resident author (Stephen is a UK resident, and the book was originally published in late 2006 in the US and the UK). Thereâd also been a book (which I thought was inferior) on the same subject published in Australia in late 2006, and I was worried that thereâd be limited media interest left for our title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happened, a number of things clicked, and we decided suddenly to bring the author out for a quick tour, during which he scored a number of high-profile media interviews. The book was also reviewed favourably and prominently, and it started to sell fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or we thought it did. By 6 March, after several days of heavy ordering from the book trade, there was almost no stock left in our distributorâs warehouse, and I knew we had to reprint. I consulted Bookscan, and its most recent report told me that weâd sold a total of 368 copies by the week ending 24 February. (A few days later, it reported cumulative sales up to 3 March of 482 sales.) So the trade had gobbled up 2500 copies really fast, but Bookscan told me that less than 20 per cent of that total had really been sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had listened to Bookscan, there would have been no reprint then â or, maybe, ever. Instead, I pressed the button for another 2500 copies. By the time the reprint arrived (very quickly â on 16 March), there were over 900 back-orders logged from the trade. And as I write this blog, there are only 120 copies left from the reprint in the warehouse, and weâll be out of stock again within days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But get this: while weâve now invoiced 5000 copies, Bookscan reports cumulative sales of this title of 1714 copies (as of 31 March). If Bookscan is right, we shouldnât have reprinted at all; or if we felt we had to, we should have reprinted a much smaller quantity. If the bookshops knew what they were doing (and if we were right by responding to and anticipating their heightened demand), weâve done the right thing by the book and its author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Bookscan may turn out to be correct: all of the reprint and some of the initial print-run may end up being returned. But, intuitively, that doesnât feel likely. Certainly, if it did happen, not only would I weep and moan, but it would highlight once again just how difficult it is in the book world to know when a sale is really a sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâve talked about this case with Bookscan, and theyâre confident their figures are right. I suppose weâll all know the answer in a few monthsâ time. But, in the meantime, thereâs a new question: what do we do about another reprint?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for our bestsellersâ list, you can be confident that itâs right. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>If youâre a regular visitor to our website, youâve probably noticed a recently introduced new feature on our home page, headed âRecent Bestsellersâ. When you click on this tab, youâre presented with a list of our previous monthâs top-12 bestselling titles, listed in order of their sales.

If youâre a thoughtful or inquisitive visitor, you may have wondered what the word âbestsellerâ means in this context. The answer, it turns out, is that âit dependsâ.

I hasten to say that it doesnât depend on whimsy or wishful thinking or my subjective judgement. It depends on what you and I understand by the word âsalesâ.

Let me explain. First of all, this is what the list isnât based on. It doesnât include any sales we make outside Australia (for instance, in New Zealand), as that would distort the picture weâre aiming to present of our domestic sales rankings. And it doesnât include direct sales weâve made to organisations, authors, or individuals, as that would distort the figures for sales that have occurred in the book trade (which are known as âtrade salesâ).

More importantly â and perhaps surprisingly for many readers â the list isnât based on the number of copies of our books that weâve âsoldâ to bookshops. Thatâs because these arenât âsalesâ in the sense understood by ordinary people. These are, rather, invoices for books ordered by bookshops in the hope/expectation that theyâll sell them to the punters who wander into their stores. Any books that arenât sold are eventually returned (bookshops have to keep them for three months, and usually have up to a year after publication to return them), and the shops are then credited for them.

So, for example, a shop that orders six copies of a new title in March may return three copies in July and one copy the following February, and our initial apparent sale of six becomes a real sale of two. The trouble is, we donât know in March what our real sales will eventually turn out to be.

That is, we didnât know until Bookscan came into existence. Bookscan is a private company that tracks trade sales for its subscribers. These are real, weekly, through-the-till sales â not pretend sales, not subject-to-return sales, but bye-bye, have-a-good-life sales.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Howâs this for a Guinness world record: we and another publisher have just published a book with the same title, on the same day, about the same person, with the same retail price. Weâve published &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/kevinrudd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a journalist called Nicholas Stuart. Penguin have also published &lt;em&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/em&gt;, in their case by a journalist called Robert Macklin. Our sub-title, though, is âan unauthorised political biographyâ; theirs is âthe biographyâ. Is this coincidence, conspiracy, or cock-up? And what is the significance, if any, of the differing sub-titles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get an answer to these questions, sit back and relax while I tell the tale of the bringing of our book to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Nick Stuart pitched his idea for this book to us in December 2006, very soon after Kevin Rudd had ascended to the leadership of the parliamentary ALP, it was cast as a conventional political biography, with an emphasis on the nature and source of Ruddâs political ideas. When we discussed his proposal and how heâd go about writing the book, one of the first questions I asked Nick was whether heâd have access to Rudd (as getting information and quotes from Rudd was obviously going to be a pre-requisite for a book of this kind).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No worries, Nick told me. He knew Rudd, was on good terms with him, and was sure heâd able to interview him for the book. With this out of the way, we talked about the very tight schedule the book would involve. The key publishing decision was picking a publication date; and this, in turn, was based on picking the earliest date on which we thought the election might be held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We estimated that the prime minister would probably not go to the people before October (because of the time heâd need to try to wear the new leader down, and because he wouldnât want to be accused of going too early). If we were right, and given our sense that we needed to have our book in the shops at least three months before the election for it to have maximum impact, we had to publish at the beginning of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to meet this date, though, we had to have finished copies in our distributorâs warehouse by late May. And in order to do that, we would have to send the files to our printers in early May. I calculated that, before then, we would need about a month to edit, typeset, and proof the manuscript (by way of comparison, most books would take several months for this process). So Nick had to deliver his manuscript in early April â in four monthsâ time, from a standing start, with no research or writing yet started. It was a very big ask, for him and us. But we both committed to it, with our eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a series of unexpected events happened. In the new year, I undertook a review of our sales and distribution arrangements, and eventually decided to move them from Pan Macmillan to Penguin. I decided that the change should take place at the beginning of July 2007, as it would be the beginning of our new financial year, would give added impetus to the launch of our JulyâDecember list, and would be the least-disruptive time for what is intrinsically a difficult procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before weâd decided, though, we read that the publishing arm of Penguin had also contracted a biography of Rudd, and that it, too, was going to be published in July (presumably, theyâd gone through the same thought-processes that we had). This led to an interesting conversation, when I felt obliged to tell Penguin that one of the first of our books that their sales representatives would have to sell-in to the book trade would be competing directly with one of their own titles. To their great credit, they handled this inconvenient news with aplomb â and, indeed, their sales force went on to do a highly professional job of convincing booksellers of the respective merits of both books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick got to work, we briefed a cover designer (an important part of which was our projected sub-title: âa political biographyâ), and we felt even more committed to the tough schedule weâd set. Now that there was competition, we certainly couldnât afford to be late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a month or so later, I started to intuit that the fabled âaccessâ to the subject of our book was becoming tenuous. I donât know what it was: some murmurings of Nickâs, and a realisation that I wasnât getting any reports of interviews with Rudd. When Nick and I spoke about this, it soon became obvious that Nick was being given the runaround by Rudd and his staff, and that it would be wise for us to assume that he would be denied access for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I made a small instantaneous decision that in hindsight turned out to be crucial: we would call our book âan unauthorised political biographyâ. If Rudd was going to refuse to talk to Nick, and would instead be talking to the author of Penguinâs book, we had to make a virtue of necessity. We had to prevent any perception taking hold that our book might be inadequate by comparison because it lacked first-person quotes from Rudd, and we had to take the initiative by making it clear that our book was spin-free, neither endorsed nor supported by Rudd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick had to change his plans considerably, and inevitably had to take longer than weâd allowed for the manuscript to be written. In the end, we received it in late April, and we had just 13 days to edit, design, and typeset it, have it corrected by Nick, and proof-read by us. Somehow, working night and day, we managed to do it, and the book reached the warehouse in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Later, as if to vindicate our sub-title change, when both books were launched in late June, Rudd attended the Macklin launch, and signed copies of it alongside the author; and several early reviews of the two books pointed out that, having been denied access, Nick had been forced to dig deeper and to talk to a wider array of sources.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marketplace will decide which of the two books is better or more interesting, and both sets of authors and publishing houses are, of course, waiting for this verdict with bated breath. It is an unusual situation, unparalleled in its details, and I tell the tale of it here to demonstrate just how uncertain and weird current-affairs publishing can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another important point to make. I still donât know why Kevin Rudd refused to talk to Nick. He claims that it was because he was too busy, but this is implausible â to put it mildly. I suspect it was because of his now-well-known desire to exercise control over his media image and the messages that come out of Rudd Central. If this is the reason, it is understandable but mistaken. Hagiographies are not appropriate for prime ministerial contenders, and playing favourites always causes collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result has been that a well-disposed author and a politically sympathetic publishing house has, in effect, provided ammunition to those who are wary of or hostile to Ruddâs leadership. Already &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; has used snippets from our book as part of its anti-Rudd campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the then reviews editor for &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;, the late James Hall, looked at my list of forthcoming titles and asked me, in his quiet, sardonic way, âStill trying to overthrow the Howard government, Henry?â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was then, and still am. No political event could give me greater pleasure. I just wish that Kevin Rudd realised who his friends are, and didnât allow his mania for control to play into the hands of his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Weâve published [_Kevin Rudd_](http://scribepublications.com.au/book/kevinrudd) by a journalist called Nicholas Stuart. Penguin have also published _Kevin Rudd_, in their case by a journalist called Robert Macklin. Our sub-title, though, is âan unauthorised political biographyâ; theirs is âthe biographyâ. Is this coincidence, conspiracy, or cock-up? And what is the significance, if any, of the differing sub-titles?

To get an answer to these questions, sit back and relax while I tell the tale of the bringing of our book to market.

When Nick Stuart pitched his idea for this book to us in December 2006, very soon after Kevin Rudd had ascended to the leadership of the parliamentary ALP, it was cast as a conventional political biography, with an emphasis on the nature and source of Ruddâs political ideas. When we discussed his proposal and how heâd go about writing the book, one of the first questions I asked Nick was whether heâd have access to Rudd (as getting information and quotes from Rudd was obviously going to be a pre-requisite for a book of this kind).

No worries, Nick told me. He knew Rudd, was on good terms with him, and was sure heâd able to interview him for the book. With this out of the way, we talked about the very tight schedule the book would involve. The key publishing decision was picking a publication date; and this, in turn, was based on picking the earliest date on which we thought the election might be held.

We estimated that the prime minister would probably not go to the people before October (because of the time heâd need to try to wear the new leader down, and because he wouldnât want to be accused of going too early). If we were right, and given our sense that we needed to have our book in the shops at least three months before the election for it to have maximum impact, we had to publish at the beginning of July.

In order to meet this date, though, we had to have finished copies in our distributorâs warehouse by late May. And in order to do that, we would have to send the files to our printers in early May. I calculated that, before then, we would need about a month to edit, typeset, and proof the manuscript (by way of comparison, most books would take several months for this process). So Nick had to deliver his manuscript in early April â in four monthsâ time, from a standing start, with no research or writing yet started. It was a very big ask, for him and us. But we both committed to it, with our eyes open.

Then a series of unexpected events happened. In the new year, I undertook a review of our sales and distribution arrangements, and eventually decided to move them from Pan Macmillan to Penguin. I decided that the change should take place at the beginning of July 2007, as it would be the beginning of our new financial year, would give added impetus to the launch of our JulyâDecember list, and would be the least-disruptive time for what is intrinsically a difficult procedure.

Before weâd decided, though, we read that the publishing arm of Penguin had also contracted a biography of Rudd, and that it, too, was going to be published in July (presumably, theyâd gone through the same thought-processes that we had). This led to an interesting conversation, when I felt obliged to tell Penguin that one of the first of our books that their sales representatives would have to sell-in to the book trade would be competing directly with one of their own titles. To their great credit, they handled this inconvenient news with aplomb â and, indeed, their sales force went on to do a highly professional job of convincing booksellers of the respective merits of both books.

Nick got to work, we briefed a cover designer (an important part of which was our projected sub-title: âa political biographyâ), and we felt even more committed to the tough schedule weâd set. Now that there was competition, we certainly couldnât afford to be late.

Then, a month or so later, I started to intuit that the fabled âaccessâ to the subject of our book was becoming tenuous. I donât know what it was: some murmurings of Nickâs, and a realisation that I wasnât getting any reports of interviews with Rudd. When Nick and I spoke about this, it soon became obvious that Nick was being given the runaround by Rudd and his staff, and that it would be wise for us to assume that he would be denied access for the duration.

At this point, I made a small instantaneous decision that in hindsight turned out to be crucial: we would call our book âan unauthorised political biographyâ. If Rudd was going to refuse to talk to Nick, and would instead be talking to the author of Penguinâs book, we had to make a virtue of necessity. We had to prevent any perception taking hold that our book might be inadequate by comparison because it lacked first-person quotes from Rudd, and we had to take the initiative by making it clear that our book was spin-free, neither endorsed nor supported by Rudd.

Nick had to change his plans considerably, and inevitably had to take longer than weâd allowed for the manuscript to be written. In the end, we received it in late April, and we had just 13 days to edit, design, and typeset it, have it corrected by Nick, and proof-read by us. Somehow, working night and day, we managed to do it, and the book reached the warehouse in time.

(Later, as if to vindicate our sub-title change, when both books were launched in late June, Rudd attended the Macklin launch, and signed copies of it alongside the author; and several early reviews of the two books pointed out that, having been denied access, Nick had been forced to dig deeper and to talk to a wider array of sources.)

The marketplace will decide which of the two books is better or more interesting, and both sets of authors and publishing houses are, of course, waiting for this verdict with bated breath. It is an unusual situation, unparalleled in its details, and I tell the tale of it here to demonstrate just how uncertain and weird current-affairs publishing can be.

There is another important point to make. I still donât know why Kevin Rudd refused to talk to Nick. He claims that it was because he was too busy, but this is implausible â to put it mildly. I suspect it was because of his now-well-known desire to exercise control over his media image and the messages that come out of Rudd Central. If this is the reason, it is understandable but mistaken. Hagiographies are not appropriate for prime ministerial contenders, and playing favourites always causes collateral damage.

The result has been that a well-disposed author and a politically sympathetic publishing house has, in effect, provided ammunition to those who are wary of or hostile to Ruddâs leadership. Already _The Australian_ has used snippets from our book as part of its anti-Rudd campaign.

A few years ago, the then reviews editor for _The Australian_, the late James Hall, looked at my list of forthcoming titles and asked me, in his quiet, sardonic way, âStill trying to overthrow the Howard government, Henry?â

I was then, and still am. No political event could give me greater pleasure. I just wish that Kevin Rudd realised who his friends are, and didnât allow his mania for control to play into the hands of his enemies.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Hereâs a burst of overseas-related developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâve acquired local rights to four overseas-originated books in the last week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gift of Rain&lt;/em&gt; by Tan Twan Eng (a debut novel, published in the UK several months ago by Myrmidon, and now longlisted for this yearâs Man Booker Prize). This is a beautiful, epic tale of friendship, set in Malaya during World War II. Weâre publishing it in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anatomist&lt;/em&gt; by Bill Hayes (a biography, with imbedded illustrations, of the author Henry Gray and his collaborator, H V Carter, who created the anatomical illustrations for &lt;em&gt;Grayâs Anatomy&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most famous books in the English language). This will be published by Ballantine in the US on Boxing Day this year, and by us in early February 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End Of America&lt;/em&gt; by Naomi Wolf, an electrifying presentation and critique of the USâs descent into a âfascist shiftâ. It will be published by Chelsea Green in the US in September and by us in early October. It should be read alongside &lt;em&gt;Nemesis&lt;/em&gt; by Chalmers Johnson, which weâre also publishing in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Accidental Guerilla&lt;/em&gt; by David Kilcullen, a former Australian army officer, guerrilla warfare expert, and nowadays a highly influential âwarrior intellectualâ who has been seconded as senior counter-insurgency advisor to General David Petraeus, the commanding general of the US multinational task force in Iraq. Kilcullen was profiled in &lt;em&gt;The Weekend Australian&lt;/em&gt; on 18-19 August, the day after we acquired his book. Weâll be publishing Kilcullenâs book in late 2008/early 2009. It will be published more or less simultaneously in the US by the trade division of Oxford University Press and in the UK by Hurst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâve also just licensed UK rights in our instant best-seller, &lt;em&gt;Buying a Piece of Paris&lt;/em&gt; by Ellie Nielsen, to Atlantic Books. US rights are under negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The first thing to say is that Iâve got no idea how other publishers think, but this is whatâs on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a publisher of trade books (that is, books for general readers which are sold by the book trade) is essentially an exercise in risk management. Whatever your tastes, abilities, and interests, you know automatically that most of the titles you publish will either lose money, break even, or earn a modest amount of money. On the other hand â in my experience â if you try to tailor your list to books you donât like or care about, but that you think will make real money, you usually end up doing even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to temper your enthusiasm or even passion for the job with a kind of world-weary acceptance that the market place will always have its way with you. As a general rule, the more books you publish and print, the more will be returned unsold by the book trade. The best you can do is to try to spread the risk so that you canât be brought undone by a big mistake or a series of run-of-the-mill disasters. At the same time, you canât afford to think or publish defensively, as that would limit your horizons and imbue the whole enterprise with the spirit of defeatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means in practice, for an independent trade house without a multinational parent or majority owner, is that you have to keep a lid on advances and print-runs, while backing your imperfect judgement relentlessly, and publishing and promoting your list as effectively as possible. To put the same point a different way, the fastest way to go broke is to believe your own publicity by paying too much for books and printing too many of them. Publishers never have the luxury of forgetting about their mistakes: they eat away at their profit-and-loss statements, clog their warehouses, and have to be remaindered or pulped after a barely decent interval has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, weâre continuously looking at many books and proposals from a wide array of sources â local authors and agents, and foreign publishers and agents â that demand a great deal of attention and, often, quick responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a trade publisher has a lot to think about, including but not confined to the shape of his or her list, the state of the market, the performance of competitors, the wellbeing of their staff, the fate of their authors and, of course, the bottom line and the bank balance. Thereâs always a lot going on, and thereâs never enough time to do everything that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is whatâs going on behind the scenes when authors submit unsolicited manuscripts or book proposals to publishers like us. Itâs a fact universally acknowledged that an unsolicited manuscript has a very low chance of being of a publishable standard; thatâs why it gets put, in the first instance, in whatâs known as âthe slush pileâ. Itâs very hard to justify putting scarce editorial resources into assessing such manuscripts. And yet â as numerous mistaken rejections by publishers around the world and throughout history have shown â itâs folly to treat them all as unworthy of consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve developed over time a system for coping with this dilemma. This is spelled out on &amp;lsquo;Manuscript Submission&amp;rsquo;, which you can reach by clicking on &amp;lsquo;Submission Guidelines&amp;rsquo; on our home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we ask authors who meet our minimum qualifications to email us first before submitting. We do not read unsolicited material that arrives in the mail if the author has not emailed us first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if we ask to see sample material, we pay careful attention to the covering note and to the quality of the writing of the sample chapters, as well as to the content. Just as individuals notice and respond to body language when meeting somebody for the first time, an editor will immediately register how language  is used by a new author. Punctuation, syntax, grammar, and tone all tell a story, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals that are clearly inferior never get past this step. We reject them as soon and as briefly as possible, using uninformative language to convey the clear message that our decision is final. This, by the way, is what lies behind publishersâ apparently bland rejection letters which state that a proposal âdoes not suit our listâ. This is an admittedly nonsensical formulation, but it does the job of conveying the message that the proposal has been rejected and that thereâs no prospect of it being reconsidered .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, the briefer the rejection letter, the harsher the publishing verdict behind it. Conversely, lengthy rejection letters usually indicate that the editor/publisher found genuinely likeable qualities in the writing, but not enough to overcome its weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst kind of rejection letter, from a publisherâs point of view, is one that leaves room for a response by the author or her agent. This means fruitless correspondence is then entered into, and usually leaves both parties feeling even more unhappy. Sometimes, though, a retort is worth the pain. My favourite example of this was recently provided by an international publishing friend of mine, who rejected a proposal by a right-wing writer he despised. He wrote to the authorsâ agent: âI would rather eat ricin than publish A.B.â The agent replied: âA.B. tells me that she knows where to get you some.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If weâre impressed by the sample material, weâll ask to see the full manuscript, or as much of it as is available. At this third point in our sifting process, we come to the position I described at the beginning: trying to make a sound judgement and backing our instincts, while knowing that itâs impossible to be sure of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, at least two people, and sometime more, will be involved in this decision-making process. We try to make it a pre-condition for us deciding to offer for a manuscript that I or the acquiring editor love the writing. But love â in publishing, as in life â is not always enough. Sometimes you need good luck as well, or even just the absence of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should perhaps explain that, because of or despite what Iâve just written, weâre still expanding our list and acquiring more books than ever (although, admittedly, most of them are from published authors, both locally and overseas). Perhaps this is the triumph of hope over experience, but I still love acquiring good books and imagining how well weâll publish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So a trade publisher has a lot to think about, including but not confined to the shape of his or her list, the state of the market, the performance of competitors, the wellbeing of their staff, the fate of their authors and, of course, the bottom line and the bank balance. Thereâs always a lot going on, and thereâs never enough time to do everything that needs to be done.

This is whatâs going on behind the scenes when authors submit unsolicited manuscripts or book proposals to publishers like us. Itâs a fact universally acknowledged that an unsolicited manuscript has a very low chance of being of a publishable standard; thatâs why it gets put, in the first instance, in whatâs known as âthe slush pileâ. Itâs very hard to justify putting scarce editorial resources into assessing such manuscripts. And yet â as numerous mistaken rejections by publishers around the world and throughout history have shown â itâs folly to treat them all as unworthy of consideration.

We've developed over time a system for coping with this dilemma. This is spelled out on 'Manuscript Submission', which you can reach by clicking on 'Submission Guidelines' on our home page. 

First, we ask authors who meet our minimum qualifications to email us first before submitting. We do not read unsolicited material that arrives in the mail if the author has not emailed us first.

Second, if we ask to see sample material, we pay careful attention to the covering note and to the quality of the writing of the sample chapters, as well as to the content. Just as individuals notice and respond to body language when meeting somebody for the first time, an editor will immediately register how language  is used by a new author. Punctuation, syntax, grammar, and tone all tell a story, for better or worse.

Proposals that are clearly inferior never get past this step. We reject them as soon and as briefly as possible, using uninformative language to convey the clear message that our decision is final. This, by the way, is what lies behind publishersâ apparently bland rejection letters which state that a proposal âdoes not suit our listâ. This is an admittedly nonsensical formulation, but it does the job of conveying the message that the proposal has been rejected and that thereâs no prospect of it being reconsidered .

As a general rule, the briefer the rejection letter, the harsher the publishing verdict behind it. Conversely, lengthy rejection letters usually indicate that the editor/publisher found genuinely likeable qualities in the writing, but not enough to overcome its weaknesses.

The worst kind of rejection letter, from a publisherâs point of view, is one that leaves room for a response by the author or her agent. This means fruitless correspondence is then entered into, and usually leaves both parties feeling even more unhappy. Sometimes, though, a retort is worth the pain. My favourite example of this was recently provided by an international publishing friend of mine, who rejected a proposal by a right-wing writer he despised. He wrote to the authorsâ agent: âI would rather eat ricin than publish A.B.â The agent replied: âA.B. tells me that she knows where to get you some.â

If weâre impressed by the sample material, weâll ask to see the full manuscript, or as much of it as is available. At this third point in our sifting process, we come to the position I described at the beginning: trying to make a sound judgement and backing our instincts, while knowing that itâs impossible to be sure of the outcome. 

Usually, at least two people, and sometime more, will be involved in this decision-making process. We try to make it a pre-condition for us deciding to offer for a manuscript that I or the acquiring editor love the writing. But love â in publishing, as in life â is not always enough. Sometimes you need good luck as well, or even just the absence of bad luck.

I should perhaps explain that, because of or despite what Iâve just written, weâre still expanding our list and acquiring more books than ever (although, admittedly, most of them are from published authors, both locally and overseas). Perhaps this is the triumph of hope over experience, but I still love acquiring good books and imagining how well weâll publish them.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable recent acts of high-wire political punditry and publishing will be unveiled on 21 December, when copies of Nicholas Stuartâs &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/whatgoesup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Goes Up â¦&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; start to appear in bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 96,000-word account of the 2007 federal election is an astonishing achievement: partly written before the 24 November election, and mostly written after, it is testimony to what accomplished journalists can achieve under the most excruciating deadline pressures. Nic had to write the book with a clear view as to the likely winner: if he turned out to be wrong, the book would have had to be cancelled, as there was never going to be time to recast and rewrite it. There were non-party-political sighs of relief all round, as you might guess, when it came right on the night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Simon Hughes, books editor of &lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, has lauded Scribe in the summer 2007 issue. Citing &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thelowroad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Low Road&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Womersley as the year&amp;rsquo;s best book (&amp;lsquo;A stunning debut&amp;rsquo; novel ), he also includes &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thetearsofautumn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tears of Autumn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Charles McCarry and &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/deerhuntingwithjesus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deer Hunting with Jesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Joe Bageant in his top 20 books of the year. Hughes writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Henry Rosenbloom&amp;rsquo;s Scribe might not be raking in the big bikkies but it seems to be making all the right decisions. Whether it is buying in titles from overseas (see below for &lt;em&gt;The Tears of Autumn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deer Hunting with Jesus&lt;/em&gt;) or promoting the home-grown product (&lt;em&gt;The Low Road&lt;/em&gt;) Scribe gets our Gold Banana for 2007.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Simon. Your cheque is in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Thereâs been an undeclared guerrilla war going on for several decades between UK publishers and Australian publishers. Like most wars, itâs being fought for the financial gains that go with territorial rights; unlike most wars, however, the aggressors have never tried to clothe their naked self-interest with ethical rhetoric. Theyâve simply planted their flags in foreign lands because they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem starts in the United States, the home of much of the best writing in the English-speaking book world. When US publishers or literary agents seek to sell English-language rights to their authorsâ books, they usually look first to the UK, which has a domestic market of 60 million people â and access to many more. Although the UK is very choosy about what it wants, this is where the big bucks are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that UK publishers have almost always insisted, when they acquire domestic rights, that so-called âCommonwealthâ rights â that part of the globe which used to be coloured red â be included. Theyâve even tended to refuse to consider buying rights in books that originate in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because Australia is a highly profitable market for UK publishers. They usually donât have to pay for the Commonwealth component when they acquire the rights; they get to pay the authors what are called âexport royaltiesâ (which are around half of what are known as âhome royalties); and they sometimes sell more copies here than they do in their own country. They donât even have to publish the books here â simply distributing moderate quantities is still money for jam. The disproportionate profits go straight to their bottom lines, and help prop up their own ailing industry. This is rent-seeking and coupon-clipping on a grand scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs a wonderful rort, and itâs been going on for a long time. And the UK publishers protect it fiercely: if Australian publishers want to acquire rights to such books from the US (which requires what is known as ârights splittingâ), the default position of UK houses is that they will then refuse to offer for UK rights. This is blackmail, to put it bluntly, and it usually works. Faced with the prospect of potentially losing a largeish UK deal over a small-to-middling ANZ deal, US publishers and agents â and their UK rights agents â have tended to fold and to cede the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK houses are unapologetic about their behaviour. If pressed, they will simply aver that Australia is very important to them financially. This is certainly true, but that doesnât make it edifying or defensible. Itâs akin to nineteenth-century plantation owners claiming that slaves are essential to the profitable operation of their enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, despite the continuation of neo-colonial rule from London, an insurgency has emerged: Australian publishing has developed a rights-buying culture. Many houses, large and small, now look to acquire local rights in US titles. (Our own company has been prominent in this area.) Often, the books theyâre interested in are of relatively little interest to UK houses; but, equally often, the UK refuses to abandon its hard-line position, because it doesnât want to set an unwelcome precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day of every week, Australian publishers offer for US books, only to hear that the publishers are holding out for a UK deal, or that the UK has already âpre-emptedâ (made a knock-out offer for UK and Commonwealth rights that includes Australian rights). Sometimes the wait lasts for months â and thereâs no UK bid forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The galling thing is that Australia often understands US books better than UK publishers do â and that, when Australian houses do manage to acquire local rights, they often publish the books with verve and commercial success. They print substantial quantities, publicise the books professionally (sometimes bringing the author out for a publicity tour), and often create a market for an author that would otherwise never have existed. And they do this while paying a market price for the rights, and higher, domestic royalties to the US publishers and their authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of these successes has started to seep out more and more in the US publishing community. More US publishers and agents are nowadays prepared to split rights, and some UK houses, under this market-place pressure, are being forced to give ground: they will now acquire some books even after Australian rights have gone, and sometimes they find themselves forced to pay domestic royalty rates as the price of retaining their entitlement to Australian rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it remains the case that most UK publishers regard themselves as entitled to Australia as a territory, and refuse to cede the ground. Iâm convinced that they donât understand the bitterness and deep resentment, bordering on fury, that this stance is arousing in Australian publishing. It is a refrain I hear constantly, whether Iâm talking to colleagues in multinational houses or to fellow independents. There is no question in my mind that the UKâs position is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand very well that the UK book trade is in a sorry state, and that UK houses have come to rely on Australia to subsidise their often-marginal domestic operations. (It may even be the case that, without this subsidy, theyâd be forced to resist the punitive discounts that theyâre having to offer large retail chains.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we must put out own interests first. As in all neo-colonial enterprises, UK publishers, by protecting their own financial interests, are holding up the development of Australian publishing and the Australian book trade in general. To the extent that they prevent Australian publishing houses from reaching their potential, they weaken the financial base of our industry, and even the prospects of local authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK publishers are not entitled to Australia as a territory. It is our country, our market, and our industry. They should either pay for it on the same terms and conditions that we do â and then make professional use of the publishing rights they acquire â or else bugger off and let us get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[A slightly modified version of this piece first appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt; on 24 March 2008, under the heading &amp;lsquo;Brits in the bad books&amp;rsquo;.]&lt;/p&gt;

When US publishers or literary agents seek to sell English-language rights to their authorsâ books, they usually look first to the UK, which has a domestic market of 60 million people â and access to many more. Although the UK is very choosy about what it wants, this is where the big bucks are.

The trouble is that UK publishers have almost always insisted, when they acquire domestic rights, that so-called âCommonwealthâ rights â that part of the globe which used to be coloured red â be included. Theyâve even tended to refuse to consider buying rights in books that originate in Australia.

Why? Because Australia is a highly profitable market for UK publishers. They usually donât have to pay for the Commonwealth component when they acquire the rights; they get to pay the authors what are called âexport royaltiesâ (which are around half of what are known as âhome royalties); and they sometimes sell more copies here than they do in their own country. They donât even have to publish the books here â simply distributing moderate quantities is still money for jam. The disproportionate profits go straight to their bottom lines, and help prop up their own ailing industry. This is rent-seeking and coupon-clipping on a grand scale. 

Itâs a wonderful rort, and itâs been going on for a long time. And the UK publishers protect it fiercely: if Australian publishers want to acquire rights to such books from the US (which requires what is known as ârights splittingâ), the default position of UK houses is that they will then refuse to offer for UK rights. This is blackmail, to put it bluntly, and it usually works. Faced with the prospect of potentially losing a largeish UK deal over a small-to-middling ANZ deal, US publishers and agents â and their UK rights agents â have tended to fold and to cede the territory.

The UK houses are unapologetic about their behaviour. If pressed, they will simply aver that Australia is very important to them financially. This is certainly true, but that doesnât make it edifying or defensible. Itâs akin to nineteenth-century plantation owners claiming that slaves are essential to the profitable operation of their enterprises.

In recent years, despite the continuation of neo-colonial rule from London, an insurgency has emerged: Australian publishing has developed a rights-buying culture. Many houses, large and small, now look to acquire local rights in US titles. (Our own company has been prominent in this area.) Often, the books theyâre interested in are of relatively little interest to UK houses; but, equally often, the UK refuses to abandon its hard-line position, because it doesnât want to set an unwelcome precedent.

Every day of every week, Australian publishers offer for US books, only to hear that the publishers are holding out for a UK deal, or that the UK has already âpre-emptedâ (made a knock-out offer for UK and Commonwealth rights that includes Australian rights). Sometimes the wait lasts for months â and thereâs no UK bid forthcoming.

The galling thing is that Australia often understands US books better than UK publishers do â and that, when Australian houses do manage to acquire local rights, they often publish the books with verve and commercial success. They print substantial quantities, publicise the books professionally (sometimes bringing the author out for a publicity tour), and often create a market for an author that would otherwise never have existed. And they do this while paying a market price for the rights, and higher, domestic royalties to the US publishers and their authors.

Word of these successes has started to seep out more and more in the US publishing community. More US publishers and agents are nowadays prepared to split rights, and some UK houses, under this market-place pressure, are being forced to give ground: they will now acquire some books even after Australian rights have gone, and sometimes they find themselves forced to pay domestic royalty rates as the price of retaining their entitlement to Australian rights.

Nevertheless, it remains the case that most UK publishers regard themselves as entitled to Australia as a territory, and refuse to cede the ground. Iâm convinced that they donât understand the bitterness and deep resentment, bordering on fury, that this stance is arousing in Australian publishing. It is a refrain I hear constantly, whether Iâm talking to colleagues in multinational houses or to fellow independents. There is no question in my mind that the UKâs position is not sustainable.

I understand very well that the UK book trade is in a sorry state, and that UK houses have come to rely on Australia to subsidise their often-marginal domestic operations. (It may even be the case that, without this subsidy, theyâd be forced to resist the punitive discounts that theyâre having to offer large retail chains.)

But we must put out own interests first. As in all neo-colonial enterprises, UK publishers, by protecting their own financial interests, are holding up the development of Australian publishing and the Australian book trade in general. To the extent that they prevent Australian publishing houses from reaching their potential, they weaken the financial base of our industry, and even the prospects of local authors.

UK publishers are not entitled to Australia as a territory. It is our country, our market, and our industry. They should either pay for it on the same terms and conditions that we do â and then make professional use of the publishing rights they acquire â or else bugger off and let us get on with it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mtc.com.au/whatson.aspx?eventID=110"&gt;The Melbourne Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt; present Peter Morgan&amp;rsquo;s broadway hit &lt;em&gt;Frost/Nixon&lt;/em&gt;, from 23 May to 5 July, at The Arts Centre, Melbourne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 August 1974, Richard Nixon gave a final wave to the world before flying off into ignominy and exile, leaving the crucial questions about Watergate unanswered. All the top political journalists in America wanted to ask them, but the man who got the exclusive interview was David Frost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Reston, Jr was David Frostâs Watergate advisor for the interviews, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/theconvictionofrichardnixon"&gt;The Conviction of Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is his intimate, behind-the-scenes account of his involvement. In the book Reston explains how a British journalist of waning consequence drove the famously wily and formidable Richard Nixon to say, in an apparent personal epiphany, âI have impeached myselfâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on &lt;em&gt;Frost/Nixon&lt;/em&gt;. Call the Melbourne Theatre Company to book on 1300 723 038, or &lt;a href="http://www.mtc.com.au/default.aspx"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe would like to congratulate Max Barry, who has been chosen as one of this year&amp;rsquo;s Best Young Australian Novelists, for his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/company"&gt;Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the judges comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Smart and very funny, this is a cracking novel satirising corporate culture. It has a great premise that keeps going to the very end. Anyone working for any company beset by management-speak would identify with it and laugh out loud. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mock the inhabitants of this world, it also sympathises with their plight. A &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt; for the office worker.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his acceptance speech Robert Kenny said:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Lamb Enters the Dreaming&lt;/i&gt; arose first of all out my prime area of interest as an historian, the social history of ideas, particularly the interconnection of religion and science.  It arose specifically out my curiosity about Nathanael Pepper.  And in that it revolved around two questions: why did Nathanael convert to Christianity; and why did the evangelical community find his conversion so significant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also thanked &amp;ldquo;the History Program at La Trobe, and at The Australian Centre, University of Melbourne, and of course all at Scribe Publications.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner of the $5000 Eureka Street/Reader&amp;rsquo;s Feast Award for Social Justice/Human Rights writing was Tony Kevin for his essay The Day the Boat Sank. The essay takes Australian artist Kate Durham&amp;rsquo;s cycle of SIEV-X (Suspected Illegal Entry vessel âunknown') paintings as inspiration and revisits the sinking explored in his book &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/acertainmaritimeincident"&gt;A Certain Maritime Incident&lt;/a&gt; and its politicised aftermath. Highly commended were writers Maddy Oliver, Arnold Zable and Irfan Yusuf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The book draws on a vast array of information to build a cogent and compelling case that we do have a genuine emergency on our hands if we are to limit the rise of greenhouse gas emissions to a level at which we can limit the degradation of our planet to manageable levels,&amp;rdquo; the Governor said in his impassioned speech. &amp;ldquo;There is no doubt in my mind that this is the greatest problem confronting mankind at this time and that it has reached the level of a state of emergency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ccr_launch1" src="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/files/asset/location/75/ccr_launch1.jpg" / &gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe publisher Henry Rosenbloom said that &lt;em&gt;Climate Code Red&lt;/em&gt; may be the most important book of his 30 year publishing career.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe authors were very prominent at this year&amp;rsquo;s Brisbane Writers Festival, which ran from Wednesday, 17 September to Sunday, 21 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Doidge, the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thebrainthatchangesitself"&gt;The Brain That Changes Itself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; addressed several packed-out sessions. His book sold out, becoming the top-selling title at the festival, and setting a book-sales record for the BWF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Abani, the author of  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/songfornight"&gt;Song for Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, delivered an electrifying keynote address, and mesmerised his audiences at each of his sessions. Chris' book became the festival&amp;rsquo;s #2 bestselling title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the other Scribe authors attracted significant attention, large attendances, and good book sales: Mahvish Khan (author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/myguantanamodiary"&gt;My Guantanamo Diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which became the festival&amp;rsquo;s #9 bestselling title); Leilah Nadir (author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/theorangetreesofbaghdad"&gt;The Orange Trees of Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;; Gwynne Dyer (author of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/climatewars"&gt;Climate Wars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;); and Julian Burnside, author of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/watchingbrief"&gt;Watching Brief&lt;/a&gt;_).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe thanks all its attending authors for their enthusiastic participation in what turned out to be a well-organised and highly successful writers' festival.&lt;/p&gt;

Norman Doidge, the author of _[The Brain That Changes Itself](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thebrainthatchangesitself)_ addressed several packed-out sessions. His book sold out, becoming the top-selling title at the festival, and setting a book-sales record for the BWF.

Chris Abani, the author of  _[Song for Night](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/songfornight)_, delivered an electrifying keynote address, and mesmerised his audiences at each of his sessions. Chris' book became the festival's #2 bestselling title.

All the other Scribe authors attracted significant attention, large attendances, and good book sales: Mahvish Khan (author of _[My Guantanamo Diary](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/myguantanamodiary)_, which became the festival's #9 bestselling title); Leilah Nadir (author of _[The Orange Trees of Baghdad](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/theorangetreesofbaghdad); Gwynne Dyer (author of _[Climate Wars](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/climatewars)_); and Julian Burnside, author of _[Watching Brief](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/watchingbrief)_).

Scribe thanks all its attending authors for their enthusiastic participation in what turned out to be a well-organised and highly successful writers' festival.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Scribe has sent a three-person team to the Frankfurt Book Fair: at the recently concluded 2008 fair, our fiction acquisitions editor, Aviva Tuffield, and our translations editor, Margot Rosenbloom, accompanied me on the most stimulating and gruelling trip in world publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three of us took part in over 100 meetings with agents and publishers during the week of the fair, pitching our own wares and looking at those of others. Weâve already bought several terrific titles that we were shown, and offered for others, and thereâs been serious interest expressed in a number of our books. At this early stage, it feels like our best Frankfurt yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came across the usual bullying rights-buying behaviour by large UK houses, who keep insisting on acquiring Australian rights within the rubric of âUK and Commonwealthâ rights (as theyâre so quaintly named) when theyâre shown new titles. This is blackmail, pure and simple, as I&amp;rsquo;ve said before. By threatening to withdraw their offers, or not offer at all, unless these rights are made available to them, they gazump or freeze-out Australian publishers, sweep up Australian rights for next to nothing, pay low âexportâ royalties, and thereby prop up their bottom lines effortlessly. Perhaps these rights should be renamed âUK and British Empireâ rights, because thatâs their true neo-colonial basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, US publishers and agents are waking up to this rort, and are more prepared than ever to âsplit rightsâ, as itâs called, with Australian publishers. Even they face some difficulty, though, with their own UK sub-agents â who, in some cases, are extremely reluctant to have their work lives complicated by having to consider Australian offers and thereby antagonising the large UK publishers they depend on for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I said something to this effect last week to The Ageâs book review editor, Jason Steger, and he incorporated my typically diplomatic comments in a piece he wrote for his column, I was astonished to see my words ricochet around the world. A recently launched UK industry email-newsletter, BookBrunch, promptly headlined a report of Stegerâs column with the words âRights holders â bastards and cowardsâ. Now I know what to do to get attention: talk like an Aussie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankfurt was conducted against a backdrop of deepening anxiety about the world financial crisis, of course, but there were no obvious signs that this affected the number of participants or their buying-and-selling animal spirits. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that trade publishers, by their nature, tend to be optimistic and forward-looking. I was asked about this on Ramona Kovalâs âBook Showâ on ABC radio national on 24 October, and found myself saying that, âYou canât just retreat &amp;hellip; and hide and cower until itâs all over. You still have to assume thereâs a market for good books.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, our October âsalesâ were very strong â above budget, and above the same month last year. I put the word âsalesâ within quotation marks because, as readers of this blog will know, invoiced sales are not necessarily the same as bookshop sales. We were helped greatly by having a bestseller on our list â &lt;em&gt;The Brain That Changes Itself&lt;/em&gt; by Norman Doidge â which has now been reprinted four times, with over 20,000 copies in print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, visits to our website keep growing, to a level that would have astonished me a year ago. I think this has got a lot to do with the widespread publicity that our new books keep generating, the breadth and depth of the list, and the richness of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as financial Armageddon approaches, we gird our loins, and keep fighting the good fight.&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily, US publishers and agents are waking up to this rort, and are more prepared than ever to âsplit rightsâ, as itâs called, with Australian publishers. Even they face some difficulty, though, with their own UK sub-agents â who, in some cases, are extremely reluctant to have their work lives complicated by having to consider Australian offers and thereby antagonising the large UK publishers they depend on for a living.

When I said something to this effect last week to The Ageâs book review editor, Jason Steger, and he incorporated my typically diplomatic comments in a piece he wrote for his column, I was astonished to see my words ricochet around the world. A recently launched UK industry email-newsletter, BookBrunch, promptly headlined a report of Stegerâs column with the words âRights holders â bastards and cowardsâ. Now I know what to do to get attention: talk like an Aussie.

Frankfurt was conducted against a backdrop of deepening anxiety about the world financial crisis, of course, but there were no obvious signs that this affected the number of participants or their buying-and-selling animal spirits. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that trade publishers, by their nature, tend to be optimistic and forward-looking. I was asked about this on Ramona Kovalâs âBook Showâ on ABC radio national on 24 October, and found myself saying that, âYou canât just retreat ... and hide and cower until itâs all over. You still have to assume thereâs a market for good books.â

As it turned out, our October âsalesâ were very strong â above budget, and above the same month last year. I put the word âsalesâ within quotation marks because, as readers of this blog will know, invoiced sales are not necessarily the same as bookshop sales. We were helped greatly by having a bestseller on our list â _The Brain That Changes Itself_ by Norman Doidge â which has now been reprinted four times, with over 20,000 copies in print.

In the meantime, visits to our website keep growing, to a level that would have astonished me a year ago. I think this has got a lot to do with the widespread publicity that our new books keep generating, the breadth and depth of the list, and the richness of the site.

So, as financial Armageddon approaches, we gird our loins, and keep fighting the good fight.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;As if we all didnât have enough to worry us, the Australian government has sooled its attack dogs on the Australian publishing industry. The Productivity Commission has been given the task of investigating whether Australian territorial copyright for books should be surrendered, so that parallel imports â foreign-originated or foreign-sourced books â might be freed legally to compete with local editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand any of this, a bit of history and context is needed. In 1991, the fundamental copyright protections available to Australian authors and publishers under the Copyright Act 1968 were qualified by the introduction of two new rules that were aimed at increasing, in bureaucrat-speak, âthe timeliness and availability of books in the Australian marketâ. They were introduced, to put it bluntly, to stopping foreign-owned publishers from sitting on their rights and not exercising them, which was a practice that had been making Australian consumers and booksellers increasingly frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these rules â the so-called â30-day ruleâ â stipulated that in order for publishers to continue to be protected against parallel imports, they had to make new titles available for sale within 30 days of their first publication overseas. If a book was not published locally within this period, Australian booksellers could import it from foreign publishers and distributors themselves. A related provision, âthe 7/90-day ruleâ, obliged publishers to supply the book trade, within 90 days of being asked to do so, of copies of foreign-sourced books to which they already had rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These âuse it or lose itâ rules were the result of a lot of argy-bargy at the time between protectionists and free-traders. As it turned out, the political compromise that the rules represented was a masterstroke: it resulted in the flowering of the Australian publishing industry, to the great benefit of authors, book buyers, booksellers, book printers, and the culture as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these provisions, Australia virtually invented the trade paperback (because it was faster and cheaper to get to market than a hardback, which was the format in which the US and UK originated their titles); an improved range of books started to appear in bookshops promptly and at competitive prices; and smaller publishers, in particular, were able to expand their publishing programmes, and to support them with marketing expenditures and author tours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly at first, and then with increasing speed, a publishing industry emerged that was to become the marvel of the Western world. With territorial copyright guaranteed, a rights-buying culture emerged, and then a rights-selling one. Microscopic independent publishers became small and then medium-sized ones; new publishers emerged and flourished; multinational publishers beefed-up their local programmes; independent booksellers retained their vitality and their market-share; local authors gained more publishing choices and greater visibility; major writersâ festivals sprang up and strengthened around the country, often headlined or attended by foreign authors who otherwise wouldnât have been heard of; and the local media were continually offered a rich fare of talent to review and interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Australian book publishing has become the most successful cultural industry in the country (much more successful than the local film industry, for example) â all without any significant subsidies from government. It has never boomed financially but, compared to the US and the UK, it has become vibrant. Whereas it was once a plaything of foreign-owned distributors, it has become a complex ecosystem, with multiple symbiotic relationships increasing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is now at serious risk. There are two main ways, I think, in which the industry would be decimated if parallel imports were allowed. Without the protection of territorial copyright, rights buyers would not be able to offer for overseas titles with any confidence, and certainly would not be able to support their publication with local marketing and promotional activities. In turn, our local publishing programmes, which are effectively underwritten by our access to overseas-originated titles, would shrink: there would be a reduction in quantity and diversity, and a forced emphasis on likely bestsellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rights sellers, on the other hand, would face unbearable competition from foreign editions of their own titles â either offered at run-on marginal costs, or as remainders. In either case, their authors would get either low royalties or none at all. Local publishers would not be able to afford to pay high advances to prominent local authors, and local publishing programmes would contract significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collateral damage would also be significant. Book printers would be devastated, as their business has been built on local and UK-owned publishers printing locally to abide by the 30-day rule. Local authors and literary agents would be imperilled. And Australia would revert to its twentieth-century status of being a territorial dumping ground, our bookshops filled with books that other people wanted us to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these devastating consequences would follow from the imposition of a solution in search of a problem. Ironically, the main original problem of overseas-originated books not being available promptly no longer exists. Sometimes, we even publish US titles before theyâre available in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the alleged problem of local books being more expensive than overseas versions has been dispatched by the plunge in value of the Australian dollar against most other currencies. In any case, book pricing is more at the mercy of booksellers than you might think; in recent years, when the local dollar was high, enterprising booksellers kept their windfall profits when importing US titles. And some booksellers have given recent evidence that they favour higher â not lower â prices â by selling a range of local books above their recommended retail prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booksellers do have a legitimate grievance, but itâs not addressed by this inquiry: the ability of consumers to buy books from overseas online suppliers without having to pay GST. This is completely indefensible, and irrational â the government would earn additional revenue by levelling the GST playing field, and it would help local booksellers by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government picked up parallel importation as a fit subject for investigation as a piece of âunfinished businessâ from the previous regime. It has few dedicated proponents: one bookselling chain thatâs keen to import titles directly, whatever the cost to anybody else; a former faux-intellectual Labor premier who seems to be compensating for having turned masterly inactivity into an art form during his reign; and maybe a Labor prime minister who wants to prove his âreformâ credentials in an industry that his predecessor found too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, referring this subject to the Productivity Commission is like asking duck-hunters what theyâd like to shoot. The PC is the last redoubt of economic rationalism here, in an era when the whole world is paying very high costs for having believed that unregulated markets deliver acceptable results. As a hint of their attitude, a section of the PCâs âIssues Paperâ, just released, wonders innocently whether âdirect subsidies or other potential assistance mechanisms [could] provide similar benefits to Australian author/publishers as the parallel import restrictionsâ. This smells of so-called âtransitional arrangementsâ â drop-dead money that has been routinely proffered to all those manufacturing industries that have already been rationalised out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still to come is Kevin Ruddâs famous âdue processâ: submissions to the PC, the release of its draft report, âroundtablesâ to discuss the report, supplementary submissions, and a final report. Donât hold your breath waiting for the PC to deliver a vindication of the current arrangements, though, or for the federal government to see the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been in this business, on and off, for over thirty years: Iâve been a book printer, an author, a freelance journalist, and book reviewer; our company won the inaugural small publisher of the year award in 2006, and we won it for the second time this year. I hope thatâs enough experience to make people pay attention when I say that surrendering territorial copyright and allowing the parallel importation of books is a terrible idea. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of Australian publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, I think we can say with confidence that if you wanted to come up with a policy to produce a healthy trade-publishing industry, and everything that went with it, you would produce the 30-day rule that has governed the provision of Australian territorial copyright since 1991. Conversely, if you wanted to destroy the industry, you would do away with the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no confidence that the Productivity Commission will see it this way, or that the federal government will disagree with it. This will require a political campaign of massive proportions to overcome. I, for one, am prepared to abandon a lifetime of party-political support to stop the barbarians from getting their way.&lt;/p&gt;

Rights sellers, on the other hand, would face unbearable competition from foreign editions of their own titles â either offered at run-on marginal costs, or as remainders. In either case, their authors would get either low royalties or none at all. Local publishers would not be able to afford to pay high advances to prominent local authors, and local publishing programmes would contract significantly.

The collateral damage would also be significant. Book printers would be devastated, as their business has been built on local and UK-owned publishers printing locally to abide by the 30-day rule. Local authors and literary agents would be imperilled. And Australia would revert to its twentieth-century status of being a territorial dumping ground, our bookshops filled with books that other people wanted us to have.

All of these devastating consequences would follow from the imposition of a solution in search of a problem. Ironically, the main original problem of overseas-originated books not being available promptly no longer exists. Sometimes, we even publish US titles before theyâre available in the United Kingdom.

Even the alleged problem of local books being more expensive than overseas versions has been dispatched by the plunge in value of the Australian dollar against most other currencies. In any case, book pricing is more at the mercy of booksellers than you might think; in recent years, when the local dollar was high, enterprising booksellers kept their windfall profits when importing US titles. And some booksellers have given recent evidence that they favour higher â not lower â prices â by selling a range of local books above their recommended retail prices.

Booksellers do have a legitimate grievance, but itâs not addressed by this inquiry: the ability of consumers to buy books from overseas online suppliers without having to pay GST. This is completely indefensible, and irrational â the government would earn additional revenue by levelling the GST playing field, and it would help local booksellers by doing so.

The federal government picked up parallel importation as a fit subject for investigation as a piece of âunfinished businessâ from the previous regime. It has few dedicated proponents: one bookselling chain thatâs keen to import titles directly, whatever the cost to anybody else; a former faux-intellectual Labor premier who seems to be compensating for having turned masterly inactivity into an art form during his reign; and maybe a Labor prime minister who wants to prove his âreformâ credentials in an industry that his predecessor found too hard.

Of course, referring this subject to the Productivity Commission is like asking duck-hunters what theyâd like to shoot. The PC is the last redoubt of economic rationalism here, in an era when the whole world is paying very high costs for having believed that unregulated markets deliver acceptable results. As a hint of their attitude, a section of the PCâs âIssues Paperâ, just released, wonders innocently whether âdirect subsidies or other potential assistance mechanisms [could] provide similar benefits to Australian author/publishers as the parallel import restrictionsâ. This smells of so-called âtransitional arrangementsâ â drop-dead money that has been routinely proffered to all those manufacturing industries that have already been rationalised out of existence.

Still to come is Kevin Ruddâs famous âdue processâ: submissions to the PC, the release of its draft report, âroundtablesâ to discuss the report, supplementary submissions, and a final report. Donât hold your breath waiting for the PC to deliver a vindication of the current arrangements, though, or for the federal government to see the light.

I have been in this business, on and off, for over thirty years: Iâve been a book printer, an author, a freelance journalist, and book reviewer; our company won the inaugural small publisher of the year award in 2006, and we won it for the second time this year. I hope thatâs enough experience to make people pay attention when I say that surrendering territorial copyright and allowing the parallel importation of books is a terrible idea. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of Australian publishing.

With the benefit of hindsight, I think we can say with confidence that if you wanted to come up with a policy to produce a healthy trade-publishing industry, and everything that went with it, you would produce the 30-day rule that has governed the provision of Australian territorial copyright since 1991. Conversely, if you wanted to destroy the industry, you would do away with the rule.

I have no confidence that the Productivity Commission will see it this way, or that the federal government will disagree with it. This will require a political campaign of massive proportions to overcome. I, for one, am prepared to abandon a lifetime of party-political support to stop the barbarians from getting their way.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a former Labor premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, published an argument for cheaper books (âThe Forumâ, Weekend Australian 13-14 December 2008). His piece displays just enough knowledge to be dangerous, and enough insouciance and ignorance to be breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letâs be clear whatâs going on here. Mr Carr is seeking to justify the abandonment of territorial copyright for Australian publishers and authors on the grounds that it would result in cheaper books across the board. This is a powerful, simple rationale  â which, as it happens, is plain wrong. But even if it were right, it ignores the devastating costs of such a radical move. His pitch is seductive because it is simplistic and selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take Mr Carrâs main argument at face value, I find it extraordinary that, for a person who sits on the board of a book-retailing chain, he doesnât seem to understand the first thing about book pricing or the book industry. He quotes, amongst his examples of apparent local rip-offs, the fact that &lt;em&gt;The White Tiger&lt;/em&gt; sells for $32.95 in Australia, but only $21.53 in the US and $30.70 in Britain. Apart from the fact that he hasnât added GST to the overseas prices (which immediately makes the UK edition dearer), he doesnât mention that booksellers would have to get copies of a US title such as this into Australia in order to sell them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, booksellers have to pay for freight, compensate themselves for having to buy copies on a firm basis (not on sale-or-return basis, as they do locally) and, in the process of converting their costs from US dollars to Australian dollars, add a buffer to protect themselves against adverse currency fluctuations. The nett result of these practical factors is that, at the current $US-$Australian exchange rate, booksellers, like Mr Carrâs very own Dymocks group, multiply US prices by around 2.2 to arrive at an Australian recommended retail price inclusive of GST. Thus  &lt;em&gt;The White Tiger&lt;/em&gt;, which costs US$14.00 in America, would retail here for $30.80, assuming that booksellers didnât round the price up â a maximum potential saving of $2.15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the time, Australian editions of US-originated books sell for less than the US edition would if it were able to be imported by booksellers. Let me give you a few examples. We have just published &lt;em&gt;Obamaâs Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, by Robert Kuttner, a US paperback that retails for US$14.95 in its home country. If booksellers were able to import it, they would charge $32.95 for it. Our recommended retail price is $27.95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also just published a small-format paperback of &lt;em&gt;The Canon&lt;/em&gt; by Natalie Angier. The US retail price of $15.95 would become $35.00 in local booksellersâ hands. Our price: $27.95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We publish many local editions of US-originated titles, and most of the time they demonstrate the same price disparity in Australiaâs favour. But, what is even more extraordinary, Mr Carr doesnât seem to have noticed that Australian consumers get the further benefit of having paperback editions available to them instantly instead of the expensive hardbacks that US publishers originate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, for example, next month weâre publishing &lt;em&gt;âA Long Time Comingâ&lt;/em&gt; by Evan Thomas and Newsweek journalists, a book about the recent US election campaign. In the US, it will be published as a US$22.95 hardback, which would have an Australian RRP of $49.95. Instead, weâre publishing our edition as a paperback for $27.95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, early in 2009 weâre publishing &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Secrecy&lt;/em&gt;, by Lamar Waldron, an 864-page book on the Kennedy assassination. In the US, itâs just been released as a US$33.00 hardback, which would be priced here at around $72.50. Weâre publishing it as a paperback for $45.00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are countless examples such as these available to demonstrate how Australian consumers continually benefit from the availability of what is called the trade paperback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even comparing like with like â hardback with hardback â local pricing is often keener. I notice, for instance that the US edition of &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Owns The News&lt;/em&gt;, by Michael Wolff, a recently released hardback biography of Rupert Murdoch, retails there for $US29.95. If the Knopf edition were to be imported by local booksellers, they would charge around $66.00 for it. Instead, the Australian edition, published by Random House, is priced at $49.95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever way you look at it, the argument to abandon territorial copyright in order to reduce the retail price of books is not sustainable. It is not supported by the facts on the ground and, ultimately, is hostage to foreign-currency exchange rates and the behaviour of booksellers. This is not, to put it mildly, a sound basis for making such a major change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Carr has one extra claim to support his case: the experience of New Zealand since it allowed parallel imports ten years ago. He says that their publishing industry has thrived since then. I donât know of the report that he relies on, but I do know that this doesnât resemble the New Zealand publishing industry I deal with. Books are more expensive there than here; their indigenous publishing has been stunted and starved; and the country is essentially treated as a dumping ground by multinational publishers. This is not a picture of a healthy or growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my main areas of disagreement with Mr Carrâs argument. He seems to have no awareness of the centrality of territorial copyright, the nature of Australian publishing, or where the best interests of authors, consumers, and the culture at large lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no publishing industry of any significance in the Western world that does not rely on exercising exclusive copyright in its own territory. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine an industry that could exist without such an enforceable right. In Australia, which for many decades suffered from being a neo-colonial outpost, it is especially important in enabling indigenous publishing â and everything that goes with it â to flourish. Like taxation, territorial copyright is one of the prices we pay for civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted in a previous blog on the subject, the current copyright rules, which were introduced in 1991, have led to the emergence of a vibrant book publishing industry. In fact, in terms of its market share, Australian book publishing has become the most successful cultural industry in the country (much more successful than the local film industry, for example) â all without any significant subsidies from government. It has never boomed financially but, compared to the US and the UK, it is healthy. Whereas it was once a plaything of foreign-owned distributors, it has become a complex ecosystem, with multiple symbiotic relationships between publishers, booksellers, authors, writersâ festivals, and the media increasing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is now at serious risk if the arguments of people like Bob Carr were to be listened to by the Productivity Commission or the Rudd government. There are two main ways, I think, in which the industry would be decimated if parallel imports were allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I gave examples of US-originated titles that publishers like us acquire regularly. We can only do this if we have a territory to buy â that is, if our own territory is available to us exclusively. Without the protection of territorial copyright, no local publisher would be able to make an offer for the right to publish overseas titles here with any confidence (as our print-runs could be undermined by booksellers importing competing editions, or by overseas publishers or distributors exporting their editions, especially if the exchange rate moves in their favour). We certainly could not afford to support the publishing of such titles with local marketing and promotional activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs also possible that US rights-holders (that is, publishers or literary agents) would be reluctant to license Australian rights at all, as they might be unnerved or emboldened by the prospect of UK editions competing with theirs in our market, or they might think they could do better by exporting their own editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Australian local publishing programmes, which are underwritten by our access to profitable overseas-originated titles, would shrink: there would be a severe reduction in quantity and quality, and a forced emphasis on likely bestsellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Australian publishers selling rights would face unbearable competition from foreign editions of their own titles â either offered at run-on marginal costs, or as remainders. In either case, their authors would get either low royalties or none at all. For this reason as well, local publishers would not be able to afford to pay significant advances to prominent local authors, and local publishing programmes would contract significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collateral damage would also be significant. Book printers would be devastated, as their business has been built on local and UK-owned publishers printing locally to abide by the so-called â30-day ruleâ that currently protects copyright. Local authors and literary agents would be imperilled. Independent and serious booksellers would face a crippling loss of diversity and quality in their range. And Australia would revert to its twentieth-century status of being a territorial dumping ground, our bookshops filled with books that other people wanted us to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these consequences would follow from the imposition of Bob Carrâs simplistic solution in search of a problem. Dymocks, the company on whose board he sits, would be free to import whatever titles it wanted to, whenever it wanted to. Everybody else would be free to wander a blasted heath. Perhaps they should adopt the motto of âImport and be damned.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Carr also raises the issue of Australians increasingly buying books online at lower prices than local booksellers charge. This is true, but is a red herring. It has nothing to do with territorial copyright, and would remain a marketplace reality whatever regime were imposed. Its real significance is that it is an example of an unlevel playing field â a gift to Amazon and its ilk â as the government imposes no GST on online purchases, to the great disadvantage of local booksellers, let alone local publishers. This is a genuine reform crying out to be undertaken, which would have the added benefit of contributing to government revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Carr mentions that thereâve been five inquiries into this subject since 1988, and he hopes, exasperatedly, that this new one will be the last. A little humility might have led him to realise that the very fact that there have been no changes following so many inquiries is an indication that this is a highly complex subject, and that there might be good reasons why it has so far withstood the urgings of economic-rationalist zealots and the superficial attractions of free-market âreformsâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Carr concludes by saying that, âAll expect reform to happen, the Productivity Commission to say, âOpen the Marketâ, and the cabinet to agree.â This is precisely what he has been lobbying for. The truth is that hardly anyone else in the industry â from multinational publishers to independent publishers, from authors to literary agents, from writersâ festival directors to most booksellers â agrees with this idea. But the fix is certainly in with the referral of this question to the Productivity Commission. If it proceeds as expected, Australian publishing will face an existential threat of the utmost severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be ironic indeed if an Australian Labor government listens to the siren-song of a failed ex-premier, and tries to resurrect market fundamentalism and deregulation at a time when the whole world is suffering terribly from the consequences of such a demonstrably asinine approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A shorter version of this article appeared on ABC online at www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2450051.htm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Carr&amp;rsquo;s article can be accessed online at www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24774541-26063,00.html)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 200 submissions were sent to the commission by the due date of 20 January, and they came from a wide range of individuals and organisations. Following its evaluation of the submissions, the commission will release a draft report (in early March); arrange âroundtablesâ to discuss the draft report (MarchâApril); call for supplementary submissions (by 10 April); and issue a final report to government (13 May).&lt;/p&gt;

To do so, booksellers have to pay for freight, compensate themselves for having to buy copies on a firm basis (not on sale-or-return basis, as they do locally) and, in the process of converting their costs from US dollars to Australian dollars, add a buffer to protect themselves against adverse currency fluctuations. The nett result of these practical factors is that, at the current $US-$Australian exchange rate, booksellers, like Mr Carrâs very own Dymocks group, multiply US prices by around 2.2 to arrive at an Australian recommended retail price inclusive of GST. Thus  _The White Tiger_, which costs US$14.00 in America, would retail here for $30.80, assuming that booksellers didnât round the price up â a maximum potential saving of $2.15.

In fact, most of the time, Australian editions of US-originated books sell for less than the US edition would if it were able to be imported by booksellers. Let me give you a few examples. We have just published _Obamaâs Challenge_, by Robert Kuttner, a US paperback that retails for US$14.95 in its home country. If booksellers were able to import it, they would charge $32.95 for it. Our recommended retail price is $27.95.

We have also just published a small-format paperback of _The Canon_ by Natalie Angier. The US retail price of $15.95 would become $35.00 in local booksellersâ hands. Our price: $27.95.

We publish many local editions of US-originated titles, and most of the time they demonstrate the same price disparity in Australiaâs favour. But, what is even more extraordinary, Mr Carr doesnât seem to have noticed that Australian consumers get the further benefit of having paperback editions available to them instantly instead of the expensive hardbacks that US publishers originate.

Thus, for example, next month weâre publishing _âA Long Time Comingâ_ by Evan Thomas and Newsweek journalists, a book about the recent US election campaign. In the US, it will be published as a US$22.95 hardback, which would have an Australian RRP of $49.95. Instead, weâre publishing our edition as a paperback for $27.95.

Similarly, early in 2009 weâre publishing _Legacy of Secrecy_, by Lamar Waldron, an 864-page book on the Kennedy assassination. In the US, itâs just been released as a US$33.00 hardback, which would be priced here at around $72.50. Weâre publishing it as a paperback for $45.00.
 
There are countless examples such as these available to demonstrate how Australian consumers continually benefit from the availability of what is called the trade paperback.

But even comparing like with like â hardback with hardback â local pricing is often keener. I notice, for instance that the US edition of _The Man Who Owns The News_, by Michael Wolff, a recently released hardback biography of Rupert Murdoch, retails there for $US29.95. If the Knopf edition were to be imported by local booksellers, they would charge around $66.00 for it. Instead, the Australian edition, published by Random House, is priced at $49.95.

Whichever way you look at it, the argument to abandon territorial copyright in order to reduce the retail price of books is not sustainable. It is not supported by the facts on the ground and, ultimately, is hostage to foreign-currency exchange rates and the behaviour of booksellers. This is not, to put it mildly, a sound basis for making such a major change.

Mr Carr has one extra claim to support his case: the experience of New Zealand since it allowed parallel imports ten years ago. He says that their publishing industry has thrived since then. I donât know of the report that he relies on, but I do know that this doesnât resemble the New Zealand publishing industry I deal with. Books are more expensive there than here; their indigenous publishing has been stunted and starved; and the country is essentially treated as a dumping ground by multinational publishers. This is not a picture of a healthy or growing industry.

Which brings me to my main areas of disagreement with Mr Carrâs argument. He seems to have no awareness of the centrality of territorial copyright, the nature of Australian publishing, or where the best interests of authors, consumers, and the culture at large lie.

There is no publishing industry of any significance in the Western world that does not rely on exercising exclusive copyright in its own territory. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine an industry that could exist without such an enforceable right. In Australia, which for many decades suffered from being a neo-colonial outpost, it is especially important in enabling indigenous publishing â and everything that goes with it â to flourish. Like taxation, territorial copyright is one of the prices we pay for civilisation.

As I've noted in a previous blog on the subject, the current copyright rules, which were introduced in 1991, have led to the emergence of a vibrant book publishing industry. In fact, in terms of its market share, Australian book publishing has become the most successful cultural industry in the country (much more successful than the local film industry, for example) â all without any significant subsidies from government. It has never boomed financially but, compared to the US and the UK, it is healthy. Whereas it was once a plaything of foreign-owned distributors, it has become a complex ecosystem, with multiple symbiotic relationships between publishers, booksellers, authors, writersâ festivals, and the media increasing all the time.

All of this is now at serious risk if the arguments of people like Bob Carr were to be listened to by the Productivity Commission or the Rudd government. There are two main ways, I think, in which the industry would be decimated if parallel imports were allowed.

Earlier, I gave examples of US-originated titles that publishers like us acquire regularly. We can only do this if we have a territory to buy â that is, if our own territory is available to us exclusively. Without the protection of territorial copyright, no local publisher would be able to make an offer for the right to publish overseas titles here with any confidence (as our print-runs could be undermined by booksellers importing competing editions, or by overseas publishers or distributors exporting their editions, especially if the exchange rate moves in their favour). We certainly could not afford to support the publishing of such titles with local marketing and promotional activities.

Itâs also possible that US rights-holders (that is, publishers or literary agents) would be reluctant to license Australian rights at all, as they might be unnerved or emboldened by the prospect of UK editions competing with theirs in our market, or they might think they could do better by exporting their own editions.

Consequently, Australian local publishing programmes, which are underwritten by our access to profitable overseas-originated titles, would shrink: there would be a severe reduction in quantity and quality, and a forced emphasis on likely bestsellers.

Meanwhile, Australian publishers selling rights would face unbearable competition from foreign editions of their own titles â either offered at run-on marginal costs, or as remainders. In either case, their authors would get either low royalties or none at all. For this reason as well, local publishers would not be able to afford to pay significant advances to prominent local authors, and local publishing programmes would contract significantly.

The collateral damage would also be significant. Book printers would be devastated, as their business has been built on local and UK-owned publishers printing locally to abide by the so-called â30-day ruleâ that currently protects copyright. Local authors and literary agents would be imperilled. Independent and serious booksellers would face a crippling loss of diversity and quality in their range. And Australia would revert to its twentieth-century status of being a territorial dumping ground, our bookshops filled with books that other people wanted us to have.

All of these consequences would follow from the imposition of Bob Carrâs simplistic solution in search of a problem. Dymocks, the company on whose board he sits, would be free to import whatever titles it wanted to, whenever it wanted to. Everybody else would be free to wander a blasted heath. Perhaps they should adopt the motto of âImport and be damned.â

Bob Carr also raises the issue of Australians increasingly buying books online at lower prices than local booksellers charge. This is true, but is a red herring. It has nothing to do with territorial copyright, and would remain a marketplace reality whatever regime were imposed. Its real significance is that it is an example of an unlevel playing field â a gift to Amazon and its ilk â as the government imposes no GST on online purchases, to the great disadvantage of local booksellers, let alone local publishers. This is a genuine reform crying out to be undertaken, which would have the added benefit of contributing to government revenues.

Mr Carr mentions that thereâve been five inquiries into this subject since 1988, and he hopes, exasperatedly, that this new one will be the last. A little humility might have led him to realise that the very fact that there have been no changes following so many inquiries is an indication that this is a highly complex subject, and that there might be good reasons why it has so far withstood the urgings of economic-rationalist zealots and the superficial attractions of free-market âreformsâ.

Mr Carr concludes by saying that, âAll expect reform to happen, the Productivity Commission to say, âOpen the Marketâ, and the cabinet to agree.â This is precisely what he has been lobbying for. The truth is that hardly anyone else in the industry â from multinational publishers to independent publishers, from authors to literary agents, from writersâ festival directors to most booksellers â agrees with this idea. But the fix is certainly in with the referral of this question to the Productivity Commission. If it proceeds as expected, Australian publishing will face an existential threat of the utmost severity.

It will be ironic indeed if an Australian Labor government listens to the siren-song of a failed ex-premier, and tries to resurrect market fundamentalism and deregulation at a time when the whole world is suffering terribly from the consequences of such a demonstrably asinine approach.

Over 200 submissions were sent to the commission by the due date of 20 January, and they came from a wide range of individuals and organisations. Following its evaluation of the submissions, the commission will release a draft report (in early March); arrange âroundtablesâ to discuss the draft report (MarchâApril); call for supplementary submissions (by 10 April); and issue a final report to government (13 May).

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The Productivity Commission is now chewing over the initial submissions it received to its inquiry into the idea of allowing the parallel importation of foreign-originated books. This is what itâs faced with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ the commission has received 268 submissions to its inquiry, of which around 260 oppose the idea;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ in a historic shift, most booksellers â the supposed beneficiaries of parallel imports â have dropped their support for the proposal: around 65 per cent of booksellers by market share now oppose the idea, including the Australian Booksellers Association and the Leading Edge group of independent booksellers;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ every publisher opposes the idea â from the largest multinational to the smallest independent â and many of them have submitted lengthy, detailed, and well-argued explanations for their stance;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ apart from universal rejections from authors and literary agents, even the Copyright Agency thinks itâs a very bad idea; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ there are only two substantial submissions in favour of the idea: from the so-called Coalition for Cheaper Books, which is a front run by Dymocks, and includes the discount department stores; and from the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, which argues for the âreformâ on economic-rationalistl first principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly everybody who understands the industry is alarmed that the unilateral surrendering of territorial copyright would severely weaken Australian publishers and independent booksellers, damage the welfare of authors and Australiaâs literary culture, and devastate ancillary activities and industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the handful of submissions in favour of the idea donât attempt to argue on one of the main grounds for the inquiry being set up â that allowing parallel imports would increase the timeliness and availability of foreign-originated books in the Australian market. This is undoubtedly because they know that the current provisions have worked very well to make a wide range of overseas titles available promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole economic argument is based on the belief that parallel imports would allow âcheaper books for everyoneâ. And yet even this isnât true. At Iâve argued previously, at a $USâ$Australian exchange rate $A0.67 to $US1.00, booksellers have to multiply US prices by an average of around 2.2 to arrive at an Australian recommended retail price inclusive of GST. This makes locally printed Australian editions of US-originated books cheaper than imports of the US edition. There are countless examples of this marketplace reality provided in various publishersâ submissions to the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a parallel-import regime, this would not change. In fact, as one of the consequences would be the removal of competition in the local book-printing industry, the cost of manufacturing books â and hence of selling them â would go up. This doesnât even take account of the consequences of larger chain booksellers forcing out independents: hardly anybody in the industry seriously thinks that this would result in lower book prices, or an increased range of titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many submissions show, the argument to abandon territorial copyright in order to reduce the retail price of books is not sustainable. It is not supported by the facts on the ground and, ultimately, is hostage to foreign-currency exchange rates and the behaviour of booksellers. Of course, if the Australian dollar were to strengthen considerably against the US dollar, local prices would become higher. But this is not, to put it mildly, a sound basis for public policy, or for making such a major change to existing policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some attempt is made by the âproâ forces to argue that authors could prevent foreign remaindered or run-on editions of their books appearing in Australia by stipulating this in their contracts with overseas publishers. This is simply misguided: no contractual arrangements between authors and publishers could stop remainders being exported to Australia by third parties. To understand the authorâs perspective on the subject in depth, I recommend Tim Wintonâs magnificent submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming body of evidence has demonstrated that allowing the parallel importation of books would cause massive damage for no appreciable gain. This is not what was meant to happen â the subject was originally referred to the Productivity Commission via the Council of Australian Governments by a newly minted Labor prime minister on the assumption that thereâd be widespread support for change, and that the commission, a champion of economic rationalism, would deliver a saleable âreformâ to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what was meant to be a lay-down misere has turned into a hospital hand-pass. The economy is now in terrible trouble, and Kevin Rudd has decided that neo-liberalism is a bad thing. The commission may still recommend the abandonment of territorial copyright, of course. But could the Rudd government embark on a draconian, neo-liberal course of action that the vast majority of experts are certain would endanger the industry and the culture? Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I urge interested readers to examine the various submissions on the commissionâs website at www.pc.gov.au/projects/study/books/submissions. In particular, I recommend the submissions from Peter Carey and Tim Winton; the Australian Publishers Association (and individual houses such as Penguin, Random House, Text, Scribe, and Allen &amp;amp; Unwin, as well as the individual submission from A&amp;amp;Uâs chairman, Patrick Gallagher); and the Leading Edge group of booksellers. Collectively, these are a magnificent set of presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The Productivity Commission&amp;rsquo;s has responded to over 270 submissions to its inquiry into parallel-import restrictions for books by producing a a &amp;lsquo;discussion draft&amp;rsquo; containing several recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its central recommendation is that parallel imports &amp;lsquo;should apply for 12 months from the date of first publication of a book in Australia. Thereafter, parallel importation should be freely permitted.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe&amp;rsquo;s publisher and managing director, Henry Rosenbloom, today described the draft report as &amp;lsquo;a deeply cynical and political document.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Its key recommendation is unworkable and absurd, and is based on neo-liberal theory and not industry evidence,&amp;rsquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;It is a Claytonâs recommendation. It pretends to retain territorial copyright while setting up conditions that would effectively destroy it  &amp;ndash; and the Australian publishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;It is deeply misleading about the US and UK laws on this subject: it describes these two biggest English-language territories as âalso having parallel-import restrictions, although without time requirements for first publicationâ. This is a bizarre way to obscure the fact that the UK and UK donât limit parallel imports â they prohibit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The commission concedes that the timely and wide availability of new books is not a problem, and the most it can offer about prices is a mealy-mouthed comment that parallel-import restrictions âput upward pressure on pricesâ (in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary). What then is the basis for its recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The only conclusion can be that the commission is trying to square a circle. It has been tasked to abolish territorial copyright, and is itching to do so, but the mountain of submissions presented to its enquiry have denied it the evidence it needs. So its recommendation is a fig-leaf; beneath it is a hostile intent of highly disturbing proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;It is also outrageous that the commission made its interim report available to selected media before sending it to those individuals and organisations who have a direct stake in this debate, and who put so much thought and effort into writing submissions to the commissionâs inquiry.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>The Productivity Commission's has responded to over 270 submissions to its inquiry into parallel-import restrictions for books by producing a a 'discussion draft' containing several recommendations.

Its central recommendation is that parallel imports 'should apply for 12 months from the date of first publication of a book in Australia. Thereafter, parallel importation should be freely permitted.' 

Scribe's publisher and managing director, Henry Rosenbloom, today described the draft report as 'a deeply cynical and political document.'  

'Its key recommendation is unworkable and absurd, and is based on neo-liberal theory and not industry evidence,' he said. 

'It is a Claytonâs recommendation. It pretends to retain territorial copyright while setting up conditions that would effectively destroy it  - and the Australian publishing industry.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The story so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Productivity Commission is investigating whether or under what conditions imported editions of English-language books should be allowed to compete with Australian editions. There are two main reasons for the inquiry having been set up: the suspicion that a broad range of overseas editions are not being made available to local consumers quickly enough; and a belief that overseas editions are or would be cheaper than local versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission is the governmentâs free-market facilitator. It likes nothing more than sinking its teeth into anti-competitive or inefficient arrangements that impose undue burdens on consumers and taxpayers. So the mere fact that the book industry was referred to it by the government was a clear indication that, at the least, âreformâ of some kind was expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission knew next to nothing about the industry when it embarked on its âstudyâ, but that didnât bother it. After all, it has all-purpose economic-analysis skills at its disposal, as well as bullshit detectors that have stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the commission launched into its typical inquiry process by calling for public submissions. It received over 270; many of them were detailed and thoughtful, and presented evidence as well as arguments to make their case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were eloquent submissions from some of Australiaâs best-known and most successful authors. There were powerful submissions from publishers large and small. There were impressive submissions from industry bodies such as the Australian Booksellers Association, the Leading Edge group of independent booksellers, the Australian Publishers Association, and the Copyright Agency of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 95 per cent of the submissions opposed allowing parallel imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also overwhelming evidence that new books from the US and UK were readily available in Australia (although not as quickly as some booksellers would like). There was persuasive evidence that the prices of local editions were, in the main, cheaper than US editions (although this inevitably fluctuates with the $A-$USD exchange rate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only exception to the latter point came from the jerry-rigged âCoalition for Cheaper Booksâ, a front run by Dymocks, whose submission was distinguished by the way it sneered at publishers and used dodgy figures from a frictionless universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the basis for the inquiry was shown to be unwarranted. There is no withholding of new titles. There is no consumer rip-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well, the submissions revealed that there is almost no constituency for the abandonment of territorial copyright or the introduction of parallel imports. The industry submissions made it clear that they regard the retention of territorial copyright as essential to the existence of Australian publishing. Even booksellers support this pointâ around 65 per cent of booksellers by market share came out against the mooted reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was extremely inconvenient for the commission. It has a hatchet-job to do, but it doesnât have the evidence to justify wielding the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it do? The commission has just produced a âdiscussion draftâ that tries to square the circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It concedes that the timely and wide availability of books is not a problem, and doesnât even argue that local editions are more expensive than imported books would be (the most it says on this subject is that the existing parallel-import restrictions âput upward pressure on pricesâ â whatever that means). It even buys the industry arguments about the central importance of territorial copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, itâs in the business of removing impediments to the operation of free markets. So its central draft recommendation is that territorial copyright should apply only for 12 months from the date of first publication of a book in Australia. âThereafter, it says, âparallel importation should be freely permitted.â And after five years, the industry should be investigated again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be the most cynical, insouciant, and bizarre recommendation that the Productivity Commission has ever made. It pretends to retain territorial copyright while setting up conditions that would effectively destroy it â and the Australian publishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it is unworkable and absurd. How can publishers acquire rights to books from the United States that have a duration of one year? How can publishers sell rights to books by Australian authors, knowing that a year later they will face competition from the very editions theyâve licensed? Why would publishers market foreign-sourced books, bring authors out to tour, and maintain backlist stocks, if their rights could be taken away from them in one year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read my lips: copyright means copyright; investment needs certainty; commitment has to be reciprocal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the submissions even hinted at such a reform. This is a crazy idea that has been made in Canberra, by a commission that has learned just enough about the book business to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get a hint of the contortions that the commission is engaging in by looking at how it deals with a fundamental political problem. The United States and the United Kingdom are the countries where our parallel imports would come from, but they donât allow them in their own territories. This is not exactly the level playing field beloved of neo-liberal economists. The commission, sensitive to this potential impediment, is therefore carefully misleading about US and UK laws on this subject: it describes these two biggest English-language territories as âalso having parallel-import restrictions, although without time requirements for first publicationâ. This is a cute, elongated way to obscure the fact that the UK and UK donât limit parallel imports â they prohibit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also get a hint of what a manipulative game the commission is playing when you realise that it handed its interim report to selected media before posting it on its website, or alerting those individuals and organisations who have a direct stake in this debate, and who put so much thought and effort into writing submissions. The media were not allowed to show the document to âthird partiesâ, or to seek comments from them, before writing their pieces. Accordingly, reports such as &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;âs travelled around the country and the world, unencumbered by alternative points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what the commission is really thinking? If it intends its central recommendation to be taken seriously, itâs seriously deluded. If it has floated this for it to be punctured, consider it done. My worry is that what lies behind it is the naked intent that itâs trying to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now weâre all meant to continue this punch-and-judy show by making further submissions, before a final recommendation is made to government in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what passes for public policy-making in Australia in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What follows is Scribe&amp;rsquo;s supplementary submission to the Productivity Commission, written and sent in response to the commission&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Discussion Draft&amp;rsquo;, which was released on 20 March 2009. I found the draft to be a disgraceful and remarkably poor piece of work. If it had been submitted to us as a publishing proposal, we would have rejected it outright; and I strongly suspect that, if it were submitted as an essay in the economics/commerce faculty of any reputable university, it would be failed. The commission is due to send its final recommendation to the federal government on 13 May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commissionâs draft report is a botched job: it is unsafe, unsound, and unreliable. It demonstrates fundamental ignorance about the industry it has been investigating, it makes findings that are not supported by the evidence it adduces, and it makes recommendations that it recognises would damage the interests of Australian authors, booksellers, printers, and publishers â all because it has an a priori belief that a greater good would result from the loosening or abandonment of parallel-import restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the draft assumes what it is incapable of proving, and relies on that assumption to recommend draconian changes to the existing regulation of a successful and important cultural industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission pays lip-service to the submissions it received (over 95 per cent of which supported the retention of territorial copyright) by quoting widely from them and then ignoring them. It masks its inadequacies by using a language that only economists could love (âcultural externalitiesâ), while proving tone-deaf to the inspired prose of writers such as Tim Winton and the thoughtful, honest writings of individuals with decades of experience in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is worse, the draft report doesnât face up to the fact that the case for the prosecution has collapsed. Of the two grounds for the inquiry â supposed problems with the ready availability and the prices of overseas-originated titles â the draft report effectively abandons the first charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the second charge, after labouring mightily, the commission has produced a mouse: it demonstrates that local book prices are competitive at the average $USâ$Australian exchange rate of the past decade. Neither the supposed killer example of New Zealandâs experience after it abandoned parallel-import restrictions, nor the distortions of the Dymocks-led âCoalition for Cheaper Booksâ turn out to be persuasive. The commission has been forced to recognise that there is no supporting evidence for the second charge, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the commission avers that parallel-import restrictions must be responsible for âan upward pressure on pricesâ. Why does it say this? Because it âknowsâ on prima facie grounds that this is what happens when free markets are impeded. In the absence of forensic evidence, it relies on supposition and suspicion as a basis for proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This begs the basic question, of course: why call for submissions, at all, apart from fulfilling the need to demonstrate that due process has been followed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let there be no mistake about it. The case for the commissionâs prosecution of the industry boils down to a pre-existing belief that PIRS produce a &lt;em&gt;tendency&lt;/em&gt; to raise prices and hence to cause economy-wide damage. This belief underpins the commissionâs imperviousness to the evidence, and explains its insouciance about the adverse consequences of its draft recommendations. It is simply not interested in the details of what it regards as collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the commissionâs recommendations are awesome in their otherworldliness. They reflect an almost complete lack of feel for what goes on inside the lowly paid, high-risk, low-reward publishing industry: the long-term investments it makes in authors, employees, and titles, and its irreplaceable role in transmitting culture and a sense of community to its readers and participants. The commission regards publishing as akin to textile manufacturing, albeit with an extra âculturalâ element. In its eyes, an industry is an industry is an industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission cannot even bring itself to say straightforwardly that the beneficiaries of its recommendations â the US and the UK â protect their national cultures and publishing industries by prohibiting parallel imports. (In post-draft discussions, the commission dismissed this high-mindedly as an example of what not to do if one wishes to follow free-market principles.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because the commission does not understand the industry, it feels able to recommend a re-engineering of it that, as it happens, would make everything worse. Even then, if the industry still has a pulse, the commission proposes coming back after five years and completing the process of âliberalisationâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commissionâs central recommendation to maintain PIRs for twelve months is not just unjustified; it is inept. It is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the relative revenues that authors and publishers derive from front-list and back-list sales. And it is a figleaf for a convoluted, backdoor abandonment of territorial copyright that would, in the process, distort the industry into a shape that would be unrecognisable locally and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is death by a thousand cuts. The commission, in effect, is urging the national government to bring into being a publishing industry that would be much smaller, with a reduced local list, and which printed fewer copies of each new title (in an irony typical of the draft report, these lowered print-runs would increase unit costs and hence retail prices). As a result, independent publishers, local authors, and literary agents would face diminished prospects, and lowered incomes and revenues; some independent booksellers would be forced out as the large chains got even bigger and imported more mass-market titles; local book-printing would decline, and printing jobs would be exported; and, of course, thereâd be a significant rise in unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well, the decades-long battle for the splitting of Australian territorial rights from UK and Commonwealth rights would be over. Australia would revert to being a post-colonial dumping ground for US and UK âproductâ, where what we get to read would become more dependant than ever on the whimsies of export-sales departments in New York and London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive amount of destruction to wreak, on the sole ground that the commission believes that the retention of territorial copyright causes a tendency for prices to rise. One wonders what it would have recommended if it had any proof. Nationalisation? Transportation to England with forced labour?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the current regulations work remarkably well, but that the commission is constitutionally unable to face the consequences of this fact. Its job, after all, is to recommend reforms, not to award commendations for good performance or to preserve the status quo. Throughout its draft report, it is apparent that the commission was always going to recommend change of some kind, come what may. Its only problem is that the gap between the evidence and its recommendations requires a leap of bad faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft has succeeded in only one thing: it has aroused the fury and scorn of the entire publishing industry and its stakeholders, and among many readers and those who care about the place of the written word in Australian culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, of course, that the commission will want to change course in its final recommendations. It may revert to recommending the total abandonment of territorial copyright, or it might be tempted to fine-tune its grand design for Australian publishing. Either approach is bound to have catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it ends up recommending, I believe the commission has destroyed its own credibility on this subject. Its discussion draft demonstrates the folly of subjecting a complex cultural industry to the tender mercies of a neo-liberal economic inquisition. It is hard to imagine that a Labor government, let alone a national parliament, could accept such devastation being wrought on the flimsiest of pretexts and for such non-existent or marginal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>_What follows is Scribe's supplementary submission to the Productivity Commission, written and sent in response to the commission's 'Discussion Draft', which was released on 20 March 2009. I found the draft to be a disgraceful and remarkably poor piece of work. If it had been submitted to us as a publishing proposal, we would have rejected it outright; and I strongly suspect that, if it were submitted as an essay in the economics/commerce faculty of any reputable university, it would be failed. The commission is due to send its final recommendation to the federal government on 13 May._

The commissionâs draft report is a botched job: it is unsafe, unsound, and unreliable. It demonstrates fundamental ignorance about the industry it has been investigating, it makes findings that are not supported by the evidence it adduces, and it makes recommendations that it recognises would damage the interests of Australian authors, booksellers, printers, and publishers â all because it has an a priori belief that a greater good would result from the loosening or abandonment of parallel-import restrictions.

Ultimately, the draft assumes what it is incapable of proving, and relies on that assumption to recommend draconian changes to the existing regulation of a successful and important cultural industry.

The commission pays lip-service to the submissions it received (over 95 per cent of which supported the retention of territorial copyright) by quoting widely from them and then ignoring them. It masks its inadequacies by using a language that only economists could love (âcultural externalitiesâ), while proving tone-deaf to the inspired prose of writers such as Tim Winton and the thoughtful, honest writings of individuals with decades of experience in the industry.

What is worse, the draft report doesnât face up to the fact that the case for the prosecution has collapsed. Of the two grounds for the inquiry â supposed problems with the ready availability and the prices of overseas-originated titles â the draft report effectively abandons the first charge.

Of the second charge, after labouring mightily, the commission has produced a mouse: it demonstrates that local book prices are competitive at the average $USâ$Australian exchange rate of the past decade. Neither the supposed killer example of New Zealandâs experience after it abandoned parallel-import restrictions, nor the distortions of the Dymocks-led âCoalition for Cheaper Booksâ turn out to be persuasive. The commission has been forced to recognise that there is no supporting evidence for the second charge, either. 

Even so, the commission avers that parallel-import restrictions must be responsible for âan upward pressure on pricesâ. Why does it say this? Because it âknowsâ on prima facie grounds that this is what happens when free markets are impeded. In the absence of forensic evidence, it relies on supposition and suspicion as a basis for proceeding.

This begs the basic question, of course: why call for submissions, at all, apart from fulfilling the need to demonstrate that due process has been followed?

Let there be no mistake about it. The case for the commissionâs prosecution of the industry boils down to a pre-existing belief that PIRS produce a _tendency_ to raise prices and hence to cause economy-wide damage. This belief underpins the commissionâs imperviousness to the evidence, and explains its insouciance about the adverse consequences of its draft recommendations. It is simply not interested in the details of what it regards as collateral damage.

Not surprisingly, the commissionâs recommendations are awesome in their otherworldliness. They reflect an almost complete lack of feel for what goes on inside the lowly paid, high-risk, low-reward publishing industry: the long-term investments it makes in authors, employees, and titles, and its irreplaceable role in transmitting culture and a sense of community to its readers and participants. The commission regards publishing as akin to textile manufacturing, albeit with an extra âculturalâ element. In its eyes, an industry is an industry is an industry.

The commission cannot even bring itself to say straightforwardly that the beneficiaries of its recommendations â the US and the UK â protect their national cultures and publishing industries by prohibiting parallel imports. (In post-draft discussions, the commission dismissed this high-mindedly as an example of what not to do if one wishes to follow free-market principles.)

And because the commission does not understand the industry, it feels able to recommend a re-engineering of it that, as it happens, would make everything worse. Even then, if the industry still has a pulse, the commission proposes coming back after five years and completing the process of âliberalisationâ.

The commissionâs central recommendation to maintain PIRs for twelve months is not just unjustified; it is inept. It is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the relative revenues that authors and publishers derive from front-list and back-list sales. And it is a figleaf for a convoluted, backdoor abandonment of territorial copyright that would, in the process, distort the industry into a shape that would be unrecognisable locally and internationally.

This is death by a thousand cuts. The commission, in effect, is urging the national government to bring into being a publishing industry that would be much smaller, with a reduced local list, and which printed fewer copies of each new title (in an irony typical of the draft report, these lowered print-runs would increase unit costs and hence retail prices). As a result, independent publishers, local authors, and literary agents would face diminished prospects, and lowered incomes and revenues; some independent booksellers would be forced out as the large chains got even bigger and imported more mass-market titles; local book-printing would decline, and printing jobs would be exported; and, of course, thereâd be a significant rise in unemployment.

As well, the decades-long battle for the splitting of Australian territorial rights from UK and Commonwealth rights would be over. Australia would revert to being a post-colonial dumping ground for US and UK âproductâ, where what we get to read would become more dependant than ever on the whimsies of export-sales departments in New York and London.

This is an impressive amount of destruction to wreak, on the sole ground that the commission believes that the retention of territorial copyright causes a tendency for prices to rise. One wonders what it would have recommended if it had any proof. Nationalisation? Transportation to England with forced labour?

The truth is that the current regulations work remarkably well, but that the commission is constitutionally unable to face the consequences of this fact. Its job, after all, is to recommend reforms, not to award commendations for good performance or to preserve the status quo. Throughout its draft report, it is apparent that the commission was always going to recommend change of some kind, come what may. Its only problem is that the gap between the evidence and its recommendations requires a leap of bad faith.

The draft has succeeded in only one thing: it has aroused the fury and scorn of the entire publishing industry and its stakeholders, and among many readers and those who care about the place of the written word in Australian culture.

It is possible, of course, that the commission will want to change course in its final recommendations. It may revert to recommending the total abandonment of territorial copyright, or it might be tempted to fine-tune its grand design for Australian publishing. Either approach is bound to have catastrophic consequences.

Whatever it ends up recommending, I believe the commission has destroyed its own credibility on this subject. Its discussion draft demonstrates the folly of subjecting a complex cultural industry to the tender mercies of a neo-liberal economic inquisition. It is hard to imagine that a Labor government, let alone a national parliament, could accept such devastation being wrought on the flimsiest of pretexts and for such non-existent or marginal benefits.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Robert Kenny has won the 2008 Prime Ministerâs Prize for Australian History for his book &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thelambentersthedreaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lamb Enters the Dreaming: Nathanael Pepper and the ruptured world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Robert is a co-winner with Tom Griffiths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judges described the book as âtruly original, surprising and profound.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Kenny will receive his prize of $50,000 and a gold medallion on 14 July at a ceremony in Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize money couldnât be more timely, as Robert Kenny sadly lost his house and all his possession in the fires of Black Saturday at Redesdale, Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âI feel so greatly honoured and gratified to receive this prize. When an historian takes chances in the endeavour to understand the past and how that past still lives within us, there is always the fear of being unheard, or even lampooned, but the reception &lt;em&gt;The Lamb Enters the Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; has received â with this prize from the Prime Minister as its crowning point â has vindicated the approach taken as an important means by which we can touch again our troubling past,â said Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee in their judgement remarks said that â&lt;em&gt;The Lamb Enters the Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; is a scholarly yet accessible book, elegantly written and powerfully argued. Kenny is meticulous in his use of existing sources: but he also goes beyond that and shows how historical imagination is not the enemy of accuracy.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thelambentersthedreaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lamb Enters the Dreaming: Nathanael Pepper and the ruptured world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also won the the First Book of History Award in the 2008 Victorian Premierâs Literary Awards and was the winner of the Australian History Associationâs W.K. Hancock prize 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Kenny is currently an ARC Research Fellow at La Trobe University.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;This is how a civilisation commits suicide these days: it invites sociopaths in suits to dismantle its culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its recommendation that territorial copyright for books be abandoned, the Productivity Commissionâs final report is the apotheosis of neo-liberalism in Australia. Everything is to be sacrificed to the workings of the free market â especially writers, independent booksellers, independent publishers, and the nationâs cultural integrity. The community as a whole will benefit, the commission says, and that is all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was always going to be the commissionâs stance, whatever the evidence. As I wrote at the time, the fix was in the moment that the commission was given its brief. Now, after many months of obfuscation and pretend-consultations, the commission has come clean: itâs all about price. And the commission just knows, as it always has, that book prices are too high because of territorial copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But getting from there to here has been unexpectedly difficult. The commissionâs draft report â with its yawning gap between evidence and recommendations, and its ludicrous support for a 12-month limit to territorial copyright â was universally and rightly derided. Its final report is better argued and more plausible, but it is a triumph of style over substance. Its tone is reasonable, its method and conclusions more internally consistent, but its stance exposes a brutal underlying ideology that still ignores any inconvenient evidence that cuts across its trust in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a flavour of this, strangely enough, in the commissionâs dismal attempts to discuss the cultural benefits of books. This is so pedestrian, so utilitarian a section, that it is painful to read. It represents a doffing of the cap by the commission to recognising the personal, intrinsic value of books, before it gets on to the main game of hitting the industry as hard as it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its draft report, the commission acknowledged that allowing parallel imports on a cold-turkey basis would cause too much damage to the industry. Now, itâs decided that the damage is tolerable, at least to it. Whatâs changed in the meantime? Itâs hard to avoid the conclusion that the commission has been so stung by the virulence of the criticism of its draft report that it has decided to teach the industry a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission has now recommended the wreaking of havoc to the book industry on the sole ground that abandoning territorial copyright, and allowing the parallel importation of books, will lower the price of books. Its evidence for this claim comes from its studies of book prices, which show that â as many of us said at the onset of the inquiry â they fluctuate according to the exchange rates between the Australian and US &amp;amp; UK currencies. The lower the Australian dollar, the lower book prices are here, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission itself has previously acknowledged that the average price gap between local and overseas English-language editions is eliminated if exchange rates of GBP 0.41 and USD 0.67 are used (which is very close to the average of the last 10 years). In its most recent study, for the period July 2008 to May 2009, it finds that, in RRP terms, the price of the cheapest available edition of titles in Australia is, on average, 13 per cent higher than the lowest-cost UK edition, and 27 per cent higher than the US lowest-cost edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think, as the commission does, that this is an open-and-shut case. As it happens, it isnât. Even ignoring the fact that the commission canât be sure it has compared like-with-like editions â so that a smaller-format, more cheaply produced US edition isnât being compared with a larger, higher-quality local edition â thereâs a key cost-component missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its study of comparative book prices, the commission has not included the cost of overseas freight. This crucial fact is hidden in the commissionâs language: it says that it âhas not sought to adjust retail prices to reflect differences in freight costsâ. These are highly misleading weasel words, so close to a lie as to be indistinguishable from one. The commission hasnât excluded âdifferencesâ in freight costs â it has excluded them completely. And yet the cost of shipping books from the UK or US to Australia is significant, and would be a vital factor in the setting of book prices if the commissionâs recommendations were accepted. At average freight-costs and at current exchange rates, overseas books would be more expensive than locally produced ones â not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the commission has been forced to concede that its price comparisons, âdo not of themselves attempt to indicate the price at which the books sold in other countries &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been sold in Australiaâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the point of them? The commission is free to assume a frictionless universe â where books magically appear at no cost thousands of kilometres from their point of origin â but nobody else can. Bookshops certainly couldnât and wouldnât.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a disgraceful sleight-of-hand by the commission. The whole basis of its assertion that Australian book prices are higher because of the operation of parallel-import restrictions â and that they would drop with the abandonment of PIRs â is phoney. This is typical of its whole approach. It knows it canât prove its case, so the best it can do is exclude vital evidence and continue to assert that that PIRs are responsible for a mystical âupward pressure on pricesâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even using its partial and pre-determined approach, the best argument it can come up with now is that abandoning PIRs would provide âopportunities, from time to time, for the importation and sale of at least a subset of books at lower prices from abroad â¦ [and that] movements in the currency would, in the absence of those restrictions, occasionally provide opportunities for Australian booksellers to source some stock quite cheaply from markets such as the US.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what is behind its headline recommendations: a pathetic assertion that some of the time, in some circumstances, some booksellers might be able to import cheaper books. And to achieve this highly conditional benefit, argued on specious grounds, it has recommended a radical change that would devastate the publishing industry and its authors, and along with it an important component of Australian life and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sociopaths in suits have had their say. This is now a political problem for the federal government, as it deserves to be. It sent the brief to the commission, so the report is its child. How the Rudd government deals with the report will be a crucial test of its leaderâs disavowal of the anti-social ideology of neo-liberalism â and of its connectedness to its own community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe is delighted to announce the launch of the CAL Scribe Fiction Prize. The prize is open for an unpublished manuscript by any Australian writer over 35, who may or may not have been published before.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner of the CAL Scribe Fiction Prize will be awarded a book contract from Scribe and a prize of $12,000. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribeâs Fiction Acquisitions Editor, Aviva Tuffield, said, âFor a number of years it has concerned us that the Vogel Prize is only for writers under 35 because it seems that many novelists, especially women, only find the time and have acquired the life experience to write novels later in life.â&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of late bloomers when it comes to writers, certainly in terms of getting published â and many of those are women: Elizabeth Jolley published her first novel at 53, as did Anita Brookner; Marina Lewycka was 58 when her debut, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, appeared; Annie Proulx was 58 when she won the PEN/Faulkner book award for her debut novel and the following year she won a Pulitzer Prize for &lt;em&gt;The Shipping News&lt;/em&gt;; Penelope Fitzgerald got going in her 60s; and Mary Wesley had her first adult novel published when she was 70.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And itâs not just the women: Raymond Chandler published his first story at 45 and his first novel at 51; Norman Lebrecht won the Whitbread award at the age of 54 for his first novel. All of these writers would have been disqualified from the Vogel Award.
While athletes, for example, peak in their youth, writers can develop at any stage of life and often come of age later and write their best work after a few attempts. This yearâs Orange Prize for New Writers in the UK had a shortlist of three debut women authors, none of whom was under forty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuffield said, âIt is a difficult time in the Australian fiction market right now, especially for debut authors â the ABC Fiction Prize has ended, and Australian publishers are cutting back on their fiction lists â and so we hope this prize will raise the profile of Australian fiction and find a wonderful new voice and/or novel. Scribe appreciates the assistance of Copyright Agency Limited in helping us to establish this prize.â&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner will be announced in March 2010.&lt;br&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe salutes its author Jill Jolliffe for her indefatigable, decades-long pursuit of the truth behind the murder of the Australian journalists known as the Balibo Five. Her original book on this subject, &lt;em&gt;Cover-Up&lt;/em&gt;, became the basis of the recently released movie &lt;em&gt;Balibo&lt;/em&gt; â and has now triggered an Australian Federal Police war crimes investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised and updated edition of &lt;em&gt;Cover-Up&lt;/em&gt; has recently been published by Scribe as &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/balibo"&gt;Balibo&lt;/a&gt;.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I watched all 60 episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; via a five-set DVD package Iâd bought from Amazon. Conceived and mostly written by former police reporter David Simon, the show originally ran for five seasons on the USâs cable network HBO until 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made a profound impact on me. Many laudatory comments have been written and uttered about this extraordinary television series since it screened in the United States (including by President Obama), and most of them are justified. Apart from the fact that youâll appreciate the first few episodes more by turning on the English sub-title facility (which I wish Iâd realised), it has a depth and breadth that is rare in any medium, let alone television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing, casting, acting, and production values are exceptional. But, more importantly, it a fully realised, integrated, and highly disturbing portrayal of what most us prefer not to know or think about the modern city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the show is ostensibly about life, work, and death in Baltimore, it is really about endemic corruption and the vanity of human wishes. Each institution it scrutinises â whether itâs the police force, city hall, the stevedoresâ union, the education sector, or the newspaper industry â is engaged, to a greater or lesser extent, in a conspiracy against its decent members and the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this universe, statistics are always being fudged and manipulated, grudges and vendettas are always being pursued, the wrong people are being shafted or promoted, the good guys usually have bad motivations, and the bad guys are often better than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence is a way of life, pursued with insouciant, breathtaking brutality. Whether itâs the local drug-dealers or the various mafia engaged in big business, the rules of civil society donât apply to them. In between the protection theyâve bought and the subservience they enforce, they are lords of all that they survey â until they overstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtually nobody gets the fate they deserve, and everything gets inexorably worse. Of all the bad things that happen in this series, the killings are the worst. All of them are shocking, as you might imagine, but the hardest to take involve the slaying of those who should be beyond our sympathies â drug dealers and hard-core criminals. In fact, the individuals with the most admirable characters and codes of honour turn out to be the ones we would ordinarily dismiss as beneath our contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a searing, deeply uncomfortable vision of urban life in the modern world. Seen through the unblinking eyes of its creators, the average citizen is merely fodder for these vast forces playing their own ruthless, predatory games. No institution is reliable, no politician is credible, no friend is durable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once youâve absorbed and understood the messages of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, itâs hard to see your own society in the same way again. Where Iâm writing this, for instance â in Melbourne, Australia â weâve heard any number of narratives that now sound familiar. Weâve got a health minister in the state government who claims not to have known that public hospitals around the city have been inventing patient numbers and treatment statistics for years. Weâve got a Country Fire Authority that managed not to warn rural and outer-suburban residents of catastrophic threats to their homes and lives last summer. Weâve got a government that wonât tell people that the city is running out of water, while it commits to emergency measures that can mean nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the country, take your pick. There are non-stop sleazy deals between developers and whoever they need to pay off; ex-politicians lobbying their former colleagues for outrageous favours on behalf of their corporate clients; large corporates growing more and more powerful while pumping out blander and blander advertising campaigns; and cynical training rackets for foreign students, in which the governments desperate for income and the purely mercenary âservice providersâ both have a vested interest in lying about what theyâre doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thatâs not even talking about entrenched police corruption, out-of-control violence on the streets, tabloid newspapers and television âcurrent affairsâ programs that are getting tackier and tackier, or a culture that is becoming dumber and dumber. Or global-warming denialism, which is a way of dancing with the stars while the planet burns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, itâs not the whole story. Against the odds, and despite being treated like rubbish, there are many people who live modest lives, who care about real things, and who try to help others. There are even politicians â I know some myself â who are incorruptible, and who are committed to public life as a way to improve their society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tremendous core decency to Australians. Perhaps that is why we have tended to think of ourselves as less corrupt and more moral than other Western societies. This is, to some extent, a comforting â and perhaps necessary â illusion. Individuals, as well as societies, need to maintain their self-esteem to be able to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Americans would say the same about themselves, and that this is one of the reasons that &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; never attracted high ratings, even while it was garnering critical praise. It is determinedly non-redemptive and non-comforting, and thereâs only so much of this that most people can bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; is a complex, multi-layered television novel, in an era when fewer and fewer real novels are being written and read. Like the best of its nineteenth-century predecessors, it tells its own truths in an unforgettable way, and the ripples it sends out never seem to stop lapping our shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judges comments of &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/travelsinatomicsunshine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travels in Atomic Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: âGerster has a fascinating story to tell and he has done so in a lively and compelling narrative way that makes Travels in Atomic Sunshine accessible to readers well beyond the historical profession.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;I am delighted to win such a prestigious award, and grateful to the men, women and children of the post-war military occupation of Japan who so generously shared their experiences with me. The Occupation was a sometimes messy but ultimately salutary human and cultural event. I am especially pleased that it has been recognised that so-called 'war stories&amp;rsquo; involve more than battlefields and military hardware,&amp;lsquo; said Gerster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travels in Atomic Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; is about the Australians who formed part of the British Commonwealth Occupational Forces after World War II in Japan â an occupation that brought out the best and the worst in the Australians.&lt;/p&gt;

His email (which is attached below) was sent to the media by Cato Counsel, lobbyists and public-relations advisers to the so-called &amp;lsquo;Coalition for Cheaper Books&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of Mr Smith&amp;rsquo;s letter while I was overseas, preparing to return after a post-Frankfurt break. I immediately felt compelled to write a reply, which I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced &amp;ndash; in slightly edited form &amp;ndash; below. The subject that both letters deal with is under heated debate within the federal government as it seeks to decide its position in response to the Productivity Commission report that it commissioned. You can read Mr Smith&amp;rsquo;s letter &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/files/asset/location/170/DickSmith.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Smith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long admired your public-spiritedness, but your recent letter to MPs about import restriction on books is plain wrong on every argument you make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are an independent Australian book-publishing house that I founded more than 30 years ago, and I can tell you that we &amp;ndash; and fellow independents &amp;ndash; would suffer the most if your suggestion was adopted by the federal government. My own company is regarded as an industry leader (we have twice won the Small Publisher of the Year award), and I assure you that the foreign-owned publishers you excoriate would cope, but that the independents would be placed in severe jeopardy. We all depend on territorial copyright to support and buttress our overall publishing programme; without it, our turnover and profitability would plunge, we would have little to sell or buy, and diminished means to do so. This would have a knock-on negative effect on Australian authors, independent booksellers, book printers, writers' festivals, the media, and the Australian reading public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, if parallel imports were allowed, the country as a whole would be more subject to the whims of multinational publishers &amp;ndash; not less. Only this time, the decisions would be made in New York, and not in Sydney or Melbourne. And the booksellers that would benefit most would be from the big end of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, there is no certainty, or even likelihood, despite the Productivity Commission&amp;rsquo;s best efforts, that allowing the parallel imports of books would lower prices. The government has already implicitly accepted this point, as has the so-called Coalition for Cheaper Books, which has sniffed the political wind and has abandoned its previous fervid advocacy for this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even your example of Amazon sales is wrong. Amazon and other on-line booksellers would continue to have a GST-free competitive advantage, even if parallel imports were allowed. The argument is not about on-line sales vs bookshop sales. It is about local bookshops' access to foreign-originated &amp;lsquo;product&amp;rsquo;. In particular, it is about a grab for increased market share by Dymocks and huge retailers such as Woolworths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you had informed yourself about this subject adequately before campaigning on it, and then allowing your name to be used &amp;ndash; by lobbyists for the big chains &amp;ndash; on the wrong side of a vital argument for the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

We are an independent Australian book-publishing house that I founded more than 30 years ago, and I can tell you that we - and fellow independents - would suffer the most if your suggestion was adopted by the federal government.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On 30 October, Dick Smith replied to my email to him which I&amp;rsquo;d sent earlier that day (see my previous post to this blog). A couple of hours later â while still in Athens â I replied. Here is that exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Henry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your email of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would wager that every single component used in your publishing business has been purchased through a competitive marketplace.  By this I mean your printing equipment, photocopying equipment, telephone equipment â everything used in your office and production facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also confident that you would be outraged if Dick Smith Electronics, or indeed any other business, colluded to stifle competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, I would assume that when you went to purchase your last washing machine or television you understood that Australian business has to compete in the worldâs marketplace â in fact, thatâs probably why you would have had the opportunity to purchase the goods at such a low price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you remember I owned my own independent publishing house â âAustralian Geographicâ.  I owned it for about ten years and then sold it for over $40 million to Fairfax.  Not at any time did I have any problem in competing with overseas publishers.  At that time I was totally opposed to import restrictions on books, and I still am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happen to love competition, and because Australia has benefited so much from itâs opening to world markets, I am happy to accept some of the disadvantages which accompany globalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will support import restrictions for books if you will support import restrictions for products that I would like to produce in the future for my own financial gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards
Dick Smith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your quick response. I can see that you are well-intentioned, but I still think you are misinformed. Perhaps that is why your reply is rhetorical, and does not address the specific points I made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Territorial copyright is not akin to tariff protection. It is more like sovereignty: without it, no nation can safeguard its own interests. In commercial terms, it is much more like patent law, which provides essential certainty to the originators of intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For book publishers who buy and sell in the international marketplace, territorial copyright is the bedrock for all their activities. That is why the parallel importation of books is forbidden in such havens of free-market economics as the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments that I and my fellow publishers make against parallel imports are not based on fear of competition from overseas books; they come, instead, from our understanding that a large source of our business will be removed if we are unable to have guaranteed access to our own territory when we acquire overseas-originated books or sell Australian books to overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Australian Geographic business, admirable as it was &amp;ndash; which I vividly recall you establishing and building up &amp;ndash; is not a comparable model. It would have been, had you tried to engage in international trade within it &amp;ndash; then you would have quickly learned how important territorial copyright is. I should add that, given you were producing a narrow range of Australian-themed and -branded items, it was never subject to the general trade conditions that I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument for the retention of parallel-import restrictions is not about restricting competition. If it were as simple as that, the Productivity Commission would have said so, and the decision to abandon the restrictions would have been made years ago. It is essentially about the necessary conditions for any book-publishing industry to have the confidence and the income to invest in books and authors within its own market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say in your accompanying letter to the ceo of the Australian Publishers Association that &amp;lsquo;big multinationals&amp;rsquo; have been  &amp;lsquo;ripping off Australian consumers with inflated prices&amp;rsquo;. Speaking as a non-big mini-national, I feel bound to tell you that this is simply not true. Book publishing (and retailing) operates on very skinny margins, and our book prices merely reflect all the basic conditions of our economy, especially our size and our wage levels. In particular, whether our book prices seem high or low relative to, say, US book prices, is largely dependent on the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. Given that the main course in a restaurant costs more than a 450pp large paperback, Australian book prices are, in fact, relatively modest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I must add that neither I nor my fellow publishers have been &amp;lsquo;manipulated or brain-washed&amp;rsquo; into making such arguments, as you assert in your letter to the APA. I have written many thousands of words on this subject, in two submissions to the Productivity Commission, in several posts to my blog, and in other communications. They are all &amp;ndash; for better worse &amp;ndash; all my own work, independently arrived at and expressed. The alternative is truer: we know our industry, but you are the victim of an ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On 2 November, Dick Smith replied to my latest email to him (see my previous posts to this blog). On 3 November â Melbourne Cup day â I replied. Then he and I had a further exchange. Here is that correspondence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Henry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your email of Friday 30 October (7.46pm). It looks as if self-interest is strong and booming in the publishing industry.  Good on you! Thatâs the whole basis for Capitalism. I still, however, have a feeling that the advantages are mainly going to you and similar businesses, not really to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You state â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;instead, from our understanding that a large source of our business will be removed if we are unable to have guaranteed access to our own territory when we acquire overseas-originated books or sell Australian books to overseas territories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually sounds to me like the globalised marketplace. Yes, lots of people fought against it for many years, but it seems to be a fact of life â for just about everything except books and a few other selected products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine you accept the benefits offered by the global economy in everything you buy â thatâs why I have always supported competition and I have never supported import restrictions to prevent competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that you donât really know what the marketplace would be like with the restrictions removed. That would be because you have always worked in a marketplace which has been restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am different to you â I just love competition.  To me, not having competition would be like cheating at sport, and I wouldnât be in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards
Dick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your reply of 2 November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I can see why weâll never agree: you think books are products, like widgets or shirts. Theyâre not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a widget can only be manufactured legally because a patent was originally issued to its designer or inventor. A book is even more complicated, because it can only come into existence once an author has created it. The author is protected by copyright, but he or she can only exercise this right by licensing territorial copyright. And publishers can only justify risking their resources if the territorial copyright they acquire is recognised by the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your argument, ultimately, is with copyright itself. Thereâs no doubt there would be a totally free trade in books â a competitive marketplace of the kind you love â if there were no underlying copyright protection for them. Thereâd just be a small problem, though: thereâd be no authors, no royalties, and no publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Henry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, you are wrong.  I totally support strong copyright laws and protection of authors. &lt;em&gt;âThe author is protected by copyright, but he or she can only exercise this right by licensing territorial copyrightâ&lt;/em&gt; (my underlining).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand you have this belief, however it is not based in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of globalisation we tend to have a world marketplace now. I do realise that there has been an attempt to try and keep copyright to a particular territory. However, what size should the territory be? Should it be by suburb? Obviously, that would be ridiculous. Now, with modern communication and internet, I believe authors can be protected by copyright and, on average, they will receive more royalties than when the marketplace is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I say that this, of course, will not help your business which relies on territorial restrictions. Surely you can see, that with the modern internet and communications, changes will have to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards
Dick Smith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t protect authors' interests without providing territorial copyright to them and their publishers. That&amp;rsquo;s why virtually all Australian authors and their agents strongly support retention of the current system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor, in the book marketplace, is there any confusion about what territorial copyright means: it refers to the territory controlled by nation-states, in which the rule of law applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try telling the Americans and the British that they should abandon territorial copyright. They&amp;rsquo;d laugh you out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve had many conversations with US and UK publishers and literary agents about this subject over the last year or so â including with some who would theoretically benefit from the change you support. Not one of them could understand how an Australian government would even contemplate abandoning territorial copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that the internet will weaken territorial ties. If anything, I think it will strengthen them, as rights-holders become even more cautious about the terms and conditions under which they license those rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Dick

You can't protect authors' interests without providing territorial copyright to them and their publishers. That's why virtually all Australian authors and their agents strongly support retention of the current system.

Nor, in the book marketplace, is there any confusion about what territorial copyright means: it refers to the territory controlled by nation-states, in which the rule of law applies.

Try telling the Americans and the British that they should abandon territorial copyright. They'd laugh you out of the room.

By the way, I've had many conversations with US and UK publishers and literary agents about this subject over the last year or so â including with some who would theoretically benefit from the change you support. Not one of them could understand how an Australian government would even contemplate abandoning territorial copyright.

I don't believe that the internet will weaken territorial ties. If anything, I think it will strengthen them, as rights-holders become even more cautious about the terms and conditions under which they license those rights.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;After a 16-month-long process, the Australian government has decided not to change the regulatory regime involving the parallel importation of books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a welcome decision. It represents a triumph of common sense over ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a heartening and refreshing sign that the government, from the prime minister down, is able to deal with a highly complex subject in a professional, clear-sighted way while retaining core Labor values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank everybody who contributed to the campaign to retain territorial copyright. While it has been a painful â sometimes agonising â fight, I have been tremendously impressed by the thoughtfulness, commitment, and camaraderie of all the publishers, authors, literary agents, printers, organisations and individuals involved. The result was a remarkable degree of solidarity and a treasure-trove of information about the book industry and what drives the people in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope we never have to go through this again. But, if we do, we will have at our disposal what will come to be seen as a classic political case-study in how to beat propaganda with the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The judges of the CAL Scribe Fiction Prize, Kerryn Goldsworthy, Mark Rubbo and Aviva Tuffield, are thrilled to announce the shortlist for the inaugural prize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maris Morton, âA Darker Musicâ&lt;br/&gt;
Meg Mundell, âBlack Glassâ&lt;br/&gt;
Jane Sullivan, âLittle Peopleâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for writers over 35 attracted 534 entrants, with the eldest born in 1919 (90 years old), while 22 entrants were born in the 1920s and 64 in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard was very high and it was a tough task to narrow the longlist down to just three manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviva Tuffield, Fiction Acquisitions Editor at Scribe, says: âThe judging process was quite lengthy and the judges admired all of the longlisted manuscripts. However, after much deliberation, we feel confident of the calibre of the three shortlisted works. Narrowing it down to one winner will be extremely tricky.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner will be announced on Thursday 18 February at the newly opened Wheeler Centre in Melbourne. The winner will receive $12,000 and a book contract from Scribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuffield added: âI do hope that ultimately Scribe will be able to publish more than just the winning book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the full longlist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Dunford &amp;ndash; A Butterfly Goodbye&lt;br/&gt;
Angus Gaunt &amp;ndash; Under the Ha-Ha&lt;br/&gt;
Leah Kaminsky &amp;ndash; The Waiting Room&lt;br/&gt;
Jonathan Marshall &amp;ndash; A Life of Fire&lt;br/&gt;
Maris Morton A Darker Music&lt;br/&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe is thrilled to announce that the winner of the inaugural CAL Scribe Fiction Prize is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maris Morton for her manuscript, &lt;em&gt;A Darker Music&lt;/em&gt;, a mystery that uncovers the buried secrets of a family who own a merino sheep station in Western Australia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner was officially announced on February 18 at the newly opened Wheeler Centre for Books, Writing and Ideas in Melbourne. Maris Morton will receive $12,000 and a book contract from Scribe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maris Morton was born in 1938 and &lt;em&gt;A Darker Music&lt;/em&gt; will be her first published book. She currently lives in Uki in rural NSW but has worked in various jobs around Australia including as an English teacher, shearersâ cook, shed hand, artist, art restorer and director of an art gallery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maris said of the win: âWinning the CAL Scribe Prize has made what seemed to be an impossible dream come true. I&amp;rsquo;m still pinching myself. Winning has given me an added incentive to go on doing what I love best: telling stories!â&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very tight contest in the end â almost a dead heat between the three shortlisted works â but after much wrangling and negotiation the three judges agreed that Maris Mortonâs work was the standout. The judges were Kerryn Goldsworthy, Mark Rubbo, and Aviva Tuffield. Of the winning manuscript, judge Mark Rubbo said: âIt has a strong narrative and personally I found it was an extremely satisfying read.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Meg Mundellâs &lt;em&gt;Black Glass&lt;/em&gt; and Jane Sullivanâs &lt;em&gt;Little People&lt;/em&gt; were highly commended and will be considered for publication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for writers over 35 attracted 534 entrants, with the eldest born in 1919 (90 years old), while 22 entrants were born in the 1920s and 64 in the 1930s. The standard was very high and it was a tough task to narrow the longlist down to just three manuscripts and then to choose a winner. Aviva Tuffield, Fiction Acquisitions Editor at Scribe, says: âThe judging process was quite lengthy and the judges admired all of the ten longlisted manuscripts.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scribe Fiction Prize will be run again this year, with entries opening in a couple of months. Watch our &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/prize"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for writers over 35 attracted 534 entrants, with the eldest born in 1919 (90 years old), while 22 entrants were born in the 1920s and 64 in the 1930s. The standard was very high and it was a tough task to narrow the longlist down to just three manuscripts and then to choose a winner. Aviva Tuffield, Fiction Acquisitions Editor at Scribe, says: âThe judging process was quite lengthy and the judges admired all of the ten longlisted manuscripts.â&lt;br&gt;
 
The Scribe Fiction Prize will be run again this year, with entries opening in a couple of months. Watch our [website](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/prize) for more details.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribeâs publisher, Henry Rosenbloom, says, âWe are entering the brave new world of digital publishing carefully, but enthusiastically. A member of staff has been working on this for months, conducting endless discussions, internally and externally. While thereâs no clear way forward, weâve come to the conclusion that we know as little about it as anyone else does, so we might as well learn by doing. Nevertheless, weâve been very pleased with the reaction of authors, agents, and overseas publishers to our e-book plans, and we hope to vindicate their trust as and when e-readers take off in this market.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribeâs e-books are for sale, in the first instance, at &lt;a href="http://www.ebooks.com/"&gt;www.ebooks.com&lt;/a&gt;, and Scribe will be entering into sales and distributions arrangements with other organisations in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;SBS ONE will air &lt;strong&gt;The Brain that Changes&lt;/strong&gt; Itself based on the best-selling book by Toronto psychiatrist and researcher Dr. Norman Doidge. The documentary will seek to present a strong case for reconsidering how we view the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Norman Doidge travels across North America to meet some of the pioneering researchers who made revolutionary discoveries about the plasticity of the human brain. He also visits with the people who have been most affected by this research â the patients whose lives have been forever changed â people once thought of as incurable who are now living normal lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known in scientific circles as &amp;lsquo;neuroplasticity&amp;rsquo;, this radical new approach to the brain provides an incredible way to bring the human brain back to life. Some of the cases that we meet are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ Roger Behm, a blind man who is now able to see via his tongue (and can throw a basketball into a garbage can to prove it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ Cheryl Schiltz, who was written-off by doctors when she lost her sense of balance due to a drugâs side effect. Once sentenced to a lifetime of wobbling, her brain rewired itself through a seemingly simple therapy, and has now regained her balance and returned to a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ Michelle Mack, one of the greatest examples of the brainâs ability to adapt: she was born, literally, with just half of her brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â¢ Michael Bernstein, who suffered a debilitating stroke in the prime of his life, paralysing the left side of his body. Heâs now back to his former life, as his brain functions have been rerouted and re-invigorated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It airs on SBS ONE on Tuesday, 15 June at 7.30pm in Eastern States, 7.00pm in South Australia &amp;amp; NT but there is no screening in Western Australia, due to live 2010 FIFA World Cup coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thetwin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Twin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Gerbrand Bakker, a translated Dutch title has won this yearâs International IMPAC Literary Award. The winner was announced at a ceremony in Dublin on 17 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award is managed by Dublin City Libraries, on behalf of Dublin City Council. It is sponsored by IMPAC, an international management productivity company with its European headquarters in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thetwin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Twin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was first published in Australia by Scribe in September 2008 and was translated into English by Adelaide-born translator David Colmer. Since moving to Amsterdam in the early 1990s, Colmer has published a wide range of translations of Dutch literature. He is also a published author of fiction, and in 2009 was awarded the biennial NSW Premier&amp;rsquo;s Translation Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Colmer said of the win, âThe great thing about this prize is that it&amp;rsquo;s the only major prize where translated novels compete on an equal basis with books that were originally written in English. That&amp;rsquo;s every translator&amp;rsquo;s goal, really, for the book to come to life in the new language and for no qualifications to be necessary. It&amp;rsquo;s also fantastic that this is a library prize.  Almost all of the books I read when I was growing up were library books and the value of libraries can&amp;rsquo;t be underestimated, so for me the fact that this recognition is coming from the world&amp;rsquo;s libraries makes it even more valuable.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IMPAC Award is presented annually with the objective of promoting excellence in world literature. It is open to novels written in any language and by authors of any nationality, provided the work has been published in English or English translation in the specified time period as outlined in the rules and conditions for the year. Nominations are submitted by library systems in major cities throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>[_The Twin_](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thetwin), by Gerbrand Bakker, a translated Dutch title has won this yearâs International IMPAC Literary Award. The winner was announced at a ceremony in Dublin on 17 June.

The International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award is managed by Dublin City Libraries, on behalf of Dublin City Council. It is sponsored by IMPAC, an international management productivity company with its European headquarters in Dublin.

[_The Twin_](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thetwin), was first published in Australia by Scribe in September 2008 and was translated into English by Adelaide-born translator David Colmer. Since moving to Amsterdam in the early 1990s, Colmer has published a wide range of translations of Dutch literature. He is also a published author of fiction, and in 2009 was awarded the biennial NSW Premier's Translation Prize.

David Colmer said of the win, âThe great thing about this prize is that it's the only major prize where translated novels compete on an equal basis with books that were originally written in English. That's every translator's goal, really, for the book to come to life in the new language and for no qualifications to be necessary. It's also fantastic that this is a library prize.  Almost all of the books I read when I was growing up were library books and the value of libraries can't be underestimated, so for me the fact that this recognition is coming from the world's libraries makes it even more valuable.â

The IMPAC Award is presented annually with the objective of promoting excellence in world literature. It is open to novels written in any language and by authors of any nationality, provided the work has been published in English or English translation in the specified time period as outlined in the rules and conditions for the year. Nominations are submitted by library systems in major cities throughout the world.

The award is worth 75,000 euros to the author, and 25,000 euros to the translator.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Itâs not easy being a trade publisher in Australia these days. The outside world has caught up with us: trade is terrible, e-books are still either a promise or a threat, and there remain large uncertainties about the domestic and international economies. Thereâs no doubt that the ending of government stimulus payments and the raising of interest rates have dented consumer confidence, to the point that retailing in general is now in the worst state that many proprietors and employees can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some booksellers are already going broke, and many others are suffering severe declines in turnover and profitability. This, in turn, is putting increasing pressure on publishers to reduce costs and avoid risks. Since trade publishing is, by definition, a highly uncertain entrepreneurial activity, this is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, wages can be frozen, staff can be cut back or not replaced, some internal tasks can be outsourced, lists can be pruned, and advances to authors can be reduced. Overseas, the large multinational houses have gone through this process several times over the last few years, and thereâs still no end in sight to it. But this is self-evidently a holding operation â a recipe for survival or for accommodating decline â and not a plan for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an independent observer, you might retort that the world would be better off if fewer books were published â especially bad or mediocre books. This is true. To a publisher, though, such action only makes practical sense if itâs the competition that cuts back. With backlist titles disappearing from most bookshops, publishers are more dependent than ever before on each monthâs new releases to generate income. With this comes an increasing premium on publishing frontlist titles that will be instant commercial successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate owners of book chains and publishing houses tend to have a very instrumental attitude to these imperatives â they want to know why bookshops hold stock that doesnât sell, or why publishers donât just publish bestsellers. Iâve even known accountants to be astonished that a whole industry can be based on publishers bankrolling authors, lending their books to booksellers, paying for retail prominence, and then accepting the return of unsold books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for independent booksellers and publishers, this paradigm feels under threat. To put it most simply, if the industry cannot provide a living to its participants, it will have to change radically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I havenât talked about my own companyâs performance or prospects so far. Let me just say that we are suffering from the ailments Iâve described above, but that we remain profitable and are doing relatively well in the circumstances. A couple of months ago, our bookselling and publishing peers adjudged us the Small Publisher of the Year for the third time in the five years since the awardâs inception. Several of our books have won or been shortlisted for major domestic and overseas awards (most notably, &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/thetwin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Twin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a translated Dutch novel by Gerbrand Bakker, which won the 2010 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/theworldbeneath"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World Beneath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Cate Kennedy, which has just been shortlisted for &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;âs Book of the Year Award, after having won the Peopleâs Choice Award in the 2010 NSW Premierâs literary awards).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially, weâve been extremely lucky to have a continuing, record-breaking bestseller (&lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/book/thebrainthatchangesitself"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brain that Changes Itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Norman Doidge). As well â if youâll pardon the advertisement â our high level of efficiency and our talented staff, our investment in excellent books, and the emergence of our superb fiction list has protected us from the worst of the tradeâs woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our list has never looked stronger, and the quality has never been better. Even so, in the last month weâve suffered from the heaviest returns weâve had in our history (due mainly to a dysfunctional group of booksellers that has been wreaking havoc on the industry). And I donât want to hide the fact that it is dispiriting to see good books not selling much, and to see â after all our hard work â how difficult it has become to generate a decent income on a month-by-month basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâve been in the industry for over thirty years, and Iâve never known it as tough as this â and Iâve picked up similar vibes from my bookselling and publishing peers. This yearâs Christmas is going to be more important than usual for the whole industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The Press Christchurch Writersâ Festival, scheduled to be held this weekend at the Christchurch Town Hall (9-12 September 2010) has been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biennial event was due to bring hundreds of international and New Zealand writers and book lovers to Christchurch this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christchurch Book Festival Trust, Chair, Brian Phillips said that trustees felt they had no option but to cancel the event given the impact of the earthquake on the people of Christchurch, the damage sustained in the central city and the aftershocks which were continuing to affect the cityâs infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; âWeâve received a number of messages of support from writers, publishers and other international festivals, together with all our funders, sponsors and volunteers.   Our thanks in particular to major sponsor, The Press, for all their fantastic support in the lead up to the festival.  We hope to be able to stage the festival in some shape or form next year so keep an eye on our website for an update.â  Brian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tickets will be refunded. This may take a couple of weeks, as the Festival office is out of bounds, and we ask people to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refunds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refunds will be made on all tickets purchased for The Press Christchurch Writers Festival 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all ticket refunds, please post your tickets and include a note stating the method you used to pay for the tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For credit cards â please list your card number, and name on the card. Your refund will be credited to this account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cheques â we will post a refund cheque. We would appreciate a stamped self addressed envelope included with the tickets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For eftpos transactions &amp;ndash; we will post a refund cheque. We would appreciate a stamped self addressed envelope included with the tickets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post the tickets to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christchurch Writers Festival&lt;br/&gt;
P O Box 845&lt;br/&gt;
Christchurch 8140&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>The Press Christchurch Writersâ Festival, scheduled to be held this weekend at the Christchurch Town Hall (9-12 September 2010) has been cancelled.

The biennial event was due to bring hundreds of international and New Zealand writers and book lovers to Christchurch this weekend.

Christchurch Book Festival Trust, Chair, Brian Phillips said that trustees felt they had no option but to cancel the event given the impact of the earthquake on the people of Christchurch, the damage sustained in the central city and the aftershocks which were continuing to affect the cityâs infrastructure. 

 âWeâve received a number of messages of support from writers, publishers and other international festivals, together with all our funders, sponsors and volunteers.   Our thanks in particular to major sponsor, The Press, for all their fantastic support in the lead up to the festival.  We hope to be able to stage the festival in some shape or form next year so keep an eye on our website for an update.â  Brian said.   
 
All tickets will be refunded. This may take a couple of weeks, as the Festival office is out of bounds, and we ask people to be patient.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe has reached a multi-book publishing agreement with Lindsay Tanner, who was finance minister and a member of the cabinet in the Rudd government. Mr Tanner stepped down from the seat of Melbourne at the recent federal election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book with Scribe has the working title of SIDESHOW, and will be about the increasing dumbing down of Australian politics. It is due to be published in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Tanner said, âI am pleased to have entered into a publishing arrangement with Henry Rosenbloom of Scribe Publications, whom I have known for many years. Henry actually commissioned my first book, THE POLITICS OF POLLUTION, back in 1976.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the bookâs topic, Mr Tanner said, âMany Australians are distressed by the relentless dumbing down of political debate. This book will explore the nature and the causes of this problem, and the threat to our democracy that it poses.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribeâs CEO and publisher, Henry Rosenbloom, said of the deal, âIâm delighted that weâll be publishing Lindsayâs forthcoming books. He has a hard-won reputation as a person of integrity and a thinker of substance, and his insights should be especially valuable in the light of the recent election campaign and the formation of a minority Labor government.â&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted a demonstration of how dangerous experts can be, you needed to go no further this week than observe the Reserve Bank of Australia raising interest rates again â this time by 0.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bankâs decision meant that mortgage rates would go up by at least as much. This, in turn, would depress consumer spending. In effect, the Reserve was applying aversion therapy to consumers and exporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorities had decided they needed to impose a ârestrictiveâ monetary policy. What, you might ask, were they trying to restrict? It couldnât have been inflation, because that remains below 3 per cent, which is within their comfort zone, and is even tipped to drop in the near future. It couldnât have been housing prices or new-house building approvals, because both have been dropping. It couldnât have been retail spending, because that has been weak and getting weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only possible conclusion is that they were worried that the huge inflows of income from the continuing mining boom would eventually increase inflation to an unacceptable level. So they were engaging in a pre-emptive strike. This means, effectively, that the rest of Australia has to suffer more than it is already is because huge mining companies are making unimaginable fortunes by digging very large holes in the ground and shipping what they find there to China and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, the nation shares in the mining boom by benefiting from the balance-of payments benefits it brings, and the taxation revenues it extracts from the companies, and the employment it generates. But the current-account improvements are also driving the local currency higher â as is the imposition of higher interest rates â thereby reducing the incomes of exporters and companies that compete with imports. The taxation revenues are far too low (but thatâs another story). And the employment is moderate, given the scale of the enterprises and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, who gains, apart from the miners? Importers certainly do, as their costs come down and their prices donât come down as much. But they have to try to sell their goods to shell-shocked consumers, whose disposable income and confidence is slashed each time that interest rates are raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the nub of the problem. Readers of my most recent blog will know that Iâve described the book industry and retail trade in general as being in a parlous condition. Iâm convinced that the latest rate rise will make conditions much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to several booksellers last week â each of them very experienced and very good at what they do â and they all spontaneously described conditions as the worst theyâd ever known. One of them has been a bookseller for 35 years; the others had been in the industry for decades. A publisherâs sales representative I spoke to said that this has been the worst year in her career â and sheâd been in her job for 25 years. One bookseller told me heâd never had so few staff, or so little stock in the shop, at this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them were in double jeopardy: they had fewer customers, and those they had were spending less; and they were losing business to offshore online distributors, who were benefitting both from the high Australian dollar and the fact that they donât have to pay GST on their sales. All of the booksellers were very worried about their prospects for Christmas sales, which is the only time of the year the industry makes a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiply these examples across the country, and apply it to most retail businesses, and youâll get a sense of how weak the real economy is. Beneath the soothing rhetoric of politicians and the myopia of the financial sector, Australia is already in the grip of a growth recession. And itâs now guaranteed to get much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that the authorities have got it wrong. They and their supporters may think that an economy with around 5 per cent unemployment is always going to need pre-emptive reining-in. They may even comfort themselves by thinking that consumers always complain when interest and mortgage rates go up, but that rates have been much higher in the recent past, to no ill effect. This argument is spurious. It misses the point that the real economy is extremely weak â in a precarious condition following the global financial crisis â because consumers are very hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main reasons, I think, for this: thereâs been an understandable blow to confidence, amid a heightened sense of the dangers lurking in the global economy; thereâs been a real loss of wealth for anyone who was invested in the stockmarket, with retirees especially badly affected; and the house-price boom of recent years has meant that the average level of mortgage loans is very high, so that the repayments of such loans consume a dangerously high proportion of mortgageesâ incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bankâs behaviour means that the book trade, retail businesses in general, and participants in the non-mining part of the economy â that is, most of the country â are being treated as collateral damage. Even worse, the government continues to allow offshore retailers and distributors to avoid the 10 per cent Goods and Services Tax that all local companies must pay. So Australians are now being disadvantaged twice in their own country: once by the creation of an artificially high dollar, and again by a tax policy that discriminates in favour of foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter is unconscionable, and I have never heard any government minister or bureaucrat try to defend it. Iâve heard mutterings that itâs too hard to fix, but this is nonsense. It would be easy to require Australia Post to collect GST, and doing so would have the additional benefit of generating extra local employment. The lack of official interest in the need to create what is otherwise a much-beloved level playing field makes me suspicious. Is there a secret codicil to our free-trade agreement with the United States? Or do we only believe in a level playing field when large corporations and the financial sector benefit from it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Reserve Bank is on course to turn the current growth recession into a real recession. Businesses will go broke, unemployment will rise, and the government will add to the problems by trying to compensate for the drop in its tax revenues by cutting its own spending. By then, of course, the government will be out on its ear, the authorities will have changed tack, and the results of their handiwork will have nothing to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should just dig smaller holes in the ground in the first place. You know what they say: when youâre in a hole, stop digging.&lt;/p&gt;

So Australians are now being disadvantaged twice in their own country: once by the creation of an artificially high dollar, and again by a tax policy that discriminates in favour of foreigners.

The latter is unconscionable, and I have never heard any government minister or bureaucrat try to defend it. Iâve heard mutterings that itâs too hard to fix, but this is nonsense. It would be easy to require Australia Post to collect GST, and doing so would have the additional benefit of generating extra local employment. The lack of official interest in the need to create what is otherwise a much-beloved level playing field makes me suspicious. Is there a secret codicil to our free-trade agreement with the United States? Or do we only believe in a level playing field when large corporations and the financial sector benefit from it?

In the meantime, the Reserve Bank is on course to turn the current growth recession into a real recession. Businesses will go broke, unemployment will rise, and the government will add to the problems by trying to compensate for the drop in its tax revenues by cutting its own spending. By then, of course, the government will be out on its ear, the authorities will have changed tack, and the results of their handiwork will have nothing to do with them.

Maybe we should just dig smaller holes in the ground in the first place. You know what they say: when youâre in a hole, stop digging.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe Publications is delighted to announce the longlist for the 2011 CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for writers over 35:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sally Bothroyd, âA Cocoa Jackson Mysteryâ (NT)&lt;br&gt;
Courtney Collins, âThe Burialâ (NSW)&lt;br&gt;
Richard Gosling, âBearâ (NSW)&lt;br&gt;
John Hughes, âThe Remnantsâ (NSW)&lt;br&gt;
Lesley JÃ¸rgensen, âCat and Fiddleâ (SA)&lt;br&gt;
Jack Ramsay, âBroganâs Crossingâ (Qld)&lt;br&gt;
Dorothy Simmons, âLiving Like a Kellyâ (Vic.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe received 352 manuscripts in total from writers ranging in age from 35 to 86, and we were very pleased to see the regional range of authors (the full statistics are below). This year the prize money for the winner was increased to $15,000.
This longlist now goes to the judges of this yearâs CAL Scribe Fiction Prize: Blanche Clark, Books Editor at the Herald Sun; Mark Rubbo, CEO of Readings bookstores; and Aviva Tuffield, Fiction Acquisitions Editor at Scribe. A shortlist will be announced in the new year and the winner in February 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009 Scribe launched the CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for an unpublished manuscript by an Australian writer aged 35 and over, regardless of publication history. Many writers only find the time and have acquired the life experience to write fiction later in life. This prize recognises that there are many examples of late bloomers when it comes to writers, certainly in terms of getting published. Youth is already celebrated in so many ways, and Scribe wants to support writers who are emerging or still going strong in their prime.
It is Scribeâs intention that this prize will raise the profile of Australian fiction, demonstrate our commitment to local authors, and find a wonderful new voice and/or novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the Copyright Agency Limitedâs Cultural Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics for this yearâs CAL Scribe Fiction Prize:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender breakdown: 194 women, 158 men&lt;br&gt;
Age breakdown: Oldest is 86, one of 11 in their 80s; 46 in their 70s; 86 in their 60s; 72 in their 50s; 89 in their 40s; 48 in their 30s. &lt;br&gt;
State breakdown: ACT 25, NSW 134, NT 1, Qld 41, SA 23, Tas 8, Vic 108, WA 11, overseas 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy assassination by Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legacy of Secrecy&lt;/em&gt; reveals for the first time the secret attempts of Robert F. Kennedy and his aides to expose his brotherâs killers, using interviews with two dozen RFK associates and newly declassified files from the National Archives. &lt;em&gt;Legacy&lt;/em&gt; shows how RFK continued his war against the Mafia by focusing increasing attention on the godfathers behind JFKâs assassination, until his own murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013 is the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe is the first publisher to acquire English-language rights to &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/insidewikileaks"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside WikiLeaks: my time at the world&amp;rsquo;s most dangerous website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by defector Daniel Domscheit-Berg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe has arranged for the book to be translated from German into English, and expects to publish Inside WikiLeaks in Australia and New Zealand in April 2011. The book will be published first in Germany, by Ullstein, in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book will be a tell-all account of the operations of WikiLeaks from one of the organisationâs highest former figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe publisher and founder Henry Rosenbloom said of this acquisition: âIâm thrilled that, as an independent Australian publishing house, weâve become the first English-language publisher to acquire rights in Inside WikiLeaks â a book that is bound to arouse intense interest. Iâm also very pleased to report that, as the lead publisher, weâve been able to commission the translation from a very fine translator, UK-based Will Hobson, who is a contributing editor to Granta magazine.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Daniel Domscheit-Berg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even before his involvement with WikiLeaks, Domscheit-Berg was active in the online freedom-of-information scene. After meeting with Julian Assange in December 2007,  he started work on expanding the website. He resigned from his job at EDS in early 2009 in order to look after WikiLeaks full-time, and moved to Berlin to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German IT-specialist has now become the best-placed man in the world to provide an insight into the whistleblower project, to which he dedicated his life and for which he sacrificed all his savings, as WikiLeaks does not pay salaries. The break came in September 2010: Domscheit-Berg, who, under the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, had until then been, alongside Assange, the face of the organisation, fell out with the founder and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Domscheit-Berg is working together with others who have left the original to launch Openleaks, with the aim of building a better WikiLeaks that will avoid what they see as the old projectâs mistakes.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Beware the fury of a consumer spurned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my last post, thereâs been a major campaign launched by Australian retailers for the federal government to level the tax playing-field â to impose the nationâs 10 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on offshore online retailers as well. For years, such sales havenât been subject to either import duties or the GST if the value of an individual transaction is below one thousand dollars. Within Australia, online and in-store sales are all subject to the GST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign has provoked a volcanic outpouring of righteous anger and resentment. There have been highly critical things said and written about the billionaires identified with the campaignâs launch, and about the retail businesses they own and run. There have been examples cited of much higher local prices for consumer items than overseas ones, of poor local customer service, and of prompt deliveries from offshore online sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been arguments made that the retailers should face facts, should stop crying poor, and should either shape up to the offshore competition or ship out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this may be fair comment, but it is irrelevant to the principles at stake or the case being made. In other words, most of this adverse reaction is misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retailers big and small, as well as countless other companies being adversely affected by the current tax loophole for foreign companies, are well aware that shoppers will keep buying from offshore online sites as long as the Australian dollar remains high â whether a GST is imposed or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is arguing that consumers should have limited access to offshore sites. Nor is the campaign an attempt to protect local industry, or to prop up âinefficientâ business practices or âout-of-dateâ business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simply an expression of dismay that an Australian government should keep imposing a tax law that deliberately favours offshore businesses and disadvantages local businesses and employees. It is unconscionable that national tax law should work in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in all of the consumer fury unleashed in the response to the campaign, I havenât seen or heard anyone trying to justify the current policy on fundamental grounds. Thatâs because they canât: in effect, consumers are currently getting a price-cut that they arenât entitled to, via a tax-break thatâs indefensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have been arguing the case to the government for over a year, well before the Australian dollar rose so strongly, but have been stonewalled. The government doesnât want to go near it, ostensibly on the grounds of impractibility, but really because it doesnât want to be responsible for raising the prices that consumers pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs a supreme irony, of course, that a federal Labor government is refusing to reform a tax â in the national interest â that was introduced by its conservative opponents over its dead body. More specifically, itâs refusing to even unwind the easing of the sales-value threshold that the Howard government introduced because Customs couldnât be bothered with the work and paperwork involved in scrutinising smaller transactions. The governmentâs medium-term solution has been to handball the problem to the Productivity Commission. (Readers of this blog will know what I think of this organisation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime ministerâs recent comments on the subject (âI would be very reluctant to see Australians who are facing cost-of-living pressures not able to access shopping on the internet in the way they access it now.â) are weasel words. The topic under debate has nothing to do with âaccessâ. Itâs got everything to do with equity â or, rather, the lack of it. Julia Gillard knows the difference â sheâs campaigned on this mantra in the educational sphere all her political life. And whatâs she doing prejudging the issue, making such comments while she says sheâs waiting for the outcome of the PCâs inquiry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumers want to keep the unfair advantage theyâve been handed by the government, which is understandable. But no one should dress up this reaction as anything other than greed, rancour, or thoughtlessness, and as collateral damage caused by the introduction of the GST itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumersâ voice, the Australian Consumersâ Association, is behaving disgracefully on the subject. It refuses to address the fundamental principle involved, and pretends that the problem is either non-existent or would go away if retailers simply changed their business practices and became more efficient and consumer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs typical of this country that interest groups (whether political or commercial) behave adversarily: they argue their own case on narrow grounds, change the terms of the argument, and concede nothing to the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question that is being begged by this furore is why Australian retail prices are so much higher than US or UK prices. The answer is not because big retailers are either hopeless or profit-gouging bastards. Instead, itâs a direct reflection of the size of our economy and the living standards we regard as essential. In every economy, retail prices reflect costs â and our costs, in turn, reflect our lower economies of scale because of our much lower population, our much higher wages and conditions, and our inflated property values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those same consumers who are sneering at the retailers should stop for a moment to think about where they get their own purchasing power from in the first place. Itâs certainly not by accepting wage rates of $10 an hour, no superannuation, few social services, and a third-world level of income and social inequality. The inevitable consequence of the GST loophole staying in place is that Australian workers and their families will suffer for it â and that the federal government will be denied revenue that it needs and is entitled to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globalisation and the internet are imposing remorseless pressures on everybody subject to import competition. Is it too much to ask that an Australian government at least stop favouring foreign competitors, and that Australian consumers understand where the butter for their bread is coming from?&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>Beware the fury of a consumer spurned.

Since my last post, thereâs been a major campaign launched by Australian retailers for the federal government to level the tax playing-field â to impose the nationâs 10 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on offshore online retailers as well. For years, such sales havenât been subject to either import duties or the GST if the value of an individual transaction is below one thousand dollars. Within Australia, online and in-store sales are all subject to the GST.

The campaign has provoked a volcanic outpouring of righteous anger and resentment. There have been highly critical things said and written about the billionaires identified with the campaignâs launch, and about the retail businesses they own and run. There have been examples cited of much higher local prices for consumer items than overseas ones, of poor local customer service, and of prompt deliveries from offshore online sites.

There have been arguments made that the retailers should face facts, should stop crying poor, and should either shape up to the offshore competition or ship out.

&lt;p&gt;With strong trade demand for it, we ordered a very large print-run, which was produced by our printers, Griffin Press, in under a week.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Last weekâs announcement that the owners of the aptly re-branded REDgroup Retail â the bookselling chains of Borders/Angus &amp;amp; Roberston/Whitcoulls â had placed the group in administration provoked a flurry of bullshit, special pleading, and knee-jerk nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Carr, a board member of Dymocks, jumped onto his failed hobby-horse called Parallel Importation, and whipped it into a lather. He claimed that the chain was a victim of the Labor governmentâs wrong-headed refusal to heed the wise advice of the Productivity Commission to allow the importation of cheap foreign books. &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; dutifully reprinted his inane blog on this subject, and echoed his argument editorially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carr was wrong during the debate about territorial copyright, and heâs wrong now. If heâd ever stepped inside a Borders or A&amp;amp;R store, he might have noticed that they regularly added 10 per cent to the publisherâs recommended retail prices for frontlist titles. At the very least, this doesnât sound like a retailer trying to compete with cheap foreign imports. He might also have noticed poor customer service, a lot of out-of-date stock, odd or poor selections of new titles, and a lot of non-book items where customers used to expect to find books. Why youâd go into Borders to buy barbecues I donât know, but that was apparently part of their business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Mr Carr had kept his eyes open when he visited any stores belonging to the chain whose board he sits on, he might have noticed the opposite of what Iâve just described. And he would have noticed that, while they were struggling during 2010 â along with many of their bookselling peers and many retailers â the business was doing much better than Borders or Angus &amp;amp; Robertson. Iâll return to this point later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the chairman of the failed group wrote to the federal government, claiming that their plunge into administration was due to their lack of access to parallel imports, and competition from offshore online retailers who didnât have to pay GST or duties. The PI argument is not worth thinking about, and not just for the reasons Iâve listed above. First, thereâs hypocrisy: REDgroup&amp;rsquo;s submission to the Productivity Commission on this subject supported the continued exclusion of parallel imports when the debate was on in 2009. Second, if there were any point to it, thereâd need to be some evidence, the least of which would be signs that all booksellers have been suffering more or less equally from the problem. As the Dymocks example above indicates, and as Iâll explain below, that was certainly not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers of this blog will know that I started complaining and campaigning about the GST tax break last year, but no one should accept the absence of offshore GST as a reason or excuse for REDgroupâs failure. As Iâve argued before, the Australian dollar is so high that most customers would keep buying from offshore sites even if GST and duty added 20 per cent to the costs they had to pay. Ironically, this isnât an argument against dismantling the tax break, but it is an argument against thinking that, at current exchange rates, it would make much difference to domestic retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial reaction of the media was to parrot the claims of Carr and REDgroup, and to argue that the problems theyâd cited foreshadowed the end for bricks-and-mortar bookshops. There is no doubt that bookselling and book publishing are under tremendous pressure at the moment, but this interpretation was way off the mark. The REDgroup story is indeed a cautionary tale, but not of the type that Carr and some others think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a business goes broke, the first questions to be asked should be of the management and the owners, not of the government. So let me spell this out. Borders/A&amp;amp;R in its REDgroup incarnation was a very badly run business, for which the owners, Pacific Equity Partners, a private-equity group, are responsible. PEP deliberately created a brutalist regime: they installed bovver-boy managers who alienated all their inherited knowledgeable staff (who left), made appalling decisions about stock selection and presentation, and tried to treat books like potatoes. They were focused on fluffing up the business so it could be floated, so all they seemed to care about was inventory control and their cash position. As they tormented their suppliers â who understood their business better than they did â things started to go badly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group kept refusing to listen to well-informed and well-intentioned advice, so their business declined drastically. Eventually, several times last year, the group was âon stopâ with major publishers â that is, the publishers refused to supply books to them because the group was in breach of its credit limits and trading terms. At other times, the group simply stopped re-ordering titles that were selling or ordering new-release titles that might have sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supermarket model that REDgroup had adopted was a grotesque failure. In the end, the group became a very good example of why bookselling is not a corporate business â itâs a hands-on, detail-intensive business, with low profit-margins. Only people who love it and know what theyâre doing can make a success of it â Internet or no Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As partial evidence for these assertions, let me proffer some internal financial information. In the 2010 calendar year, compared with the year before, Scribeâs turnover with Angus &amp;amp; Robertson company stores fell by 51 per cent. By comparison, our turnover with A &amp;amp; R franchise stores (which are effectively independents) fell by only 10 per cent. Our turnover with Borders stores within Australia (which were all company owned and run) fell by 40 per cent. For REDgroup as a whole, our turnover was down by 44 per cent. These are staggering figures, and I would be very surprised if they werenât at least typical of other publishersâ experiences. I suspect that REDgroupâs market share fell by around half during 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to other bookselling buying groups, our turnover moved in a range from -6 per cent to + 48 per cent. In other words, REDgroupâs business performance was by far the worst of any of its peers that we traded with. And we had a relatively good year: in the critical JulyâDecember period, the sales of our titles by the book trade, as measured by Bookscan, rose by 7 per cent by value and by volume, while the invoice value of our âsalesâ to the trade fell by 7.5 per cent. (For an explanation of the difference between the two, see an earlier post on this blog, headed âSales, Returns, Reprints, and Bookscanâ.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the whole of 2009, it was obvious that REDgroupâs woes were causing serious damage to all publishers. Publishing being international, its troubles were known abroad, and were the subject of great consternation. Within our own company, if I was asked for my opinion on the subject, I would say that everyone except REDgroup itself would be better if they just went broke. Iâve since heard that other publishers had come to the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite all this, PEP kept trying to exit their investment in the REDgroup by preparing it for a public flotation on the Australian Stock Exchange. If theyâd succeeded, it would have made the notorious 2009 Myer float by a fellow private-equity buccaneer, TPG, look like a responsible and well-priced endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hereby lies the final cautionary tale, which the media doesnât want to know about: the demise of the REDgroup is a good example of how hopeless our business journalism is. As Iâve indicated, everybody and his dog in the industry knew that Borders/A&amp;amp;R were in trouble. Yet no print journalist had the contacts or the wit to chase the story. Theyâve all become too used to regurgitating press releases and reporting media conferences, and even limiting that to stock-exchange-listed companies. Yet the REDgroup employed thousands of people, and their fate affects many other companies and individuals. If business journalists had been on the case, last weekâs announcement wouldnât have been such a shock â and people with vested interests wouldnât have got away with making wrong pronouncements about what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

He claimed that the chain was a victim of the Labor governmentâs wrong-headed refusal to heed the wise advice of the Productivity Commission to allow the importation of cheap foreign books. _The Australian_ dutifully reprinted his inane blog on this subject, and echoed his argument editorially.

Carr was wrong during the debate about territorial copyright, and heâs wrong now. If heâd ever stepped inside a Borders or A&amp;R store, he might have noticed that they regularly added 10 per cent to the publisherâs recommended retail prices for frontlist titles. At the very least, this doesnât sound like a retailer trying to compete with cheap foreign imports. He might also have noticed poor customer service, a lot of out-of-date stock, odd or poor selections of new titles, and a lot of non-book items where customers used to expect to find books. Why youâd go into Borders to buy barbecues I donât know, but that was apparently part of their business model.

If Mr Carr had kept his eyes open when he visited any stores belonging to the chain whose board he sits on, he might have noticed the opposite of what Iâve just described. And he would have noticed that, while they were struggling during 2010 â along with many of their bookselling peers and many retailers â the business was doing much better than Borders or Angus &amp; Robertson. Iâll return to this point later.

At the same time, the chairman of the failed group wrote to the federal government, claiming that their plunge into administration was due to their lack of access to parallel imports, and competition from offshore online retailers who didnât have to pay GST or duties. The PI argument is not worth thinking about, and not just for the reasons Iâve listed above. First, thereâs hypocrisy: REDgroup's submission to the Productivity Commission on this subject supported the continued exclusion of parallel imports when the debate was on in 2009. Second, if there were any point to it, thereâd need to be some evidence, the least of which would be signs that all booksellers have been suffering more or less equally from the problem. As the Dymocks example above indicates, and as Iâll explain below, that was certainly not the case.

Readers of this blog will know that I started complaining and campaigning about the GST tax break last year, but no one should accept the absence of offshore GST as a reason or excuse for REDgroupâs failure. As Iâve argued before, the Australian dollar is so high that most customers would keep buying from offshore sites even if GST and duty added 20 per cent to the costs they had to pay. Ironically, this isnât an argument against dismantling the tax break, but it is an argument against thinking that, at current exchange rates, it would make much difference to domestic retailers.
 
The initial reaction of the media was to parrot the claims of Carr and REDgroup, and to argue that the problems theyâd cited foreshadowed the end for bricks-and-mortar bookshops. There is no doubt that bookselling and book publishing are under tremendous pressure at the moment, but this interpretation was way off the mark. The REDgroup story is indeed a cautionary tale, but not of the type that Carr and some others think.

Whenever a business goes broke, the first questions to be asked should be of the management and the owners, not of the government. So let me spell this out. Borders/A&amp;R in its REDgroup incarnation was a very badly run business, for which the owners, Pacific Equity Partners, a private-equity group, are responsible. PEP deliberately created a brutalist regime: they installed bovver-boy managers who alienated all their inherited knowledgeable staff (who left), made appalling decisions about stock selection and presentation, and tried to treat books like potatoes. They were focused on fluffing up the business so it could be floated, so all they seemed to care about was inventory control and their cash position. As they tormented their suppliers â who understood their business better than they did â things started to go badly wrong. 

The group kept refusing to listen to well-informed and well-intentioned advice, so their business declined drastically. Eventually, several times last year, the group was âon stopâ with major publishers â that is, the publishers refused to supply books to them because the group was in breach of its credit limits and trading terms. At other times, the group simply stopped re-ordering titles that were selling or ordering new-release titles that might have sold.

The supermarket model that REDgroup had adopted was a grotesque failure. In the end, the group became a very good example of why bookselling is not a corporate business â itâs a hands-on, detail-intensive business, with low profit-margins. Only people who love it and know what theyâre doing can make a success of it â Internet or no Internet.

As partial evidence for these assertions, let me proffer some internal financial information. In the 2010 calendar year, compared with the year before, Scribeâs turnover with Angus &amp; Robertson company stores fell by 51 per cent. By comparison, our turnover with A &amp; R franchise stores (which are effectively independents) fell by only 10 per cent. Our turnover with Borders stores within Australia (which were all company owned and run) fell by 40 per cent. For REDgroup as a whole, our turnover was down by 44 per cent. These are staggering figures, and I would be very surprised if they werenât at least typical of other publishersâ experiences. I suspect that REDgroupâs market share fell by around half during 2010.

As to other bookselling buying groups, our turnover moved in a range from -6 per cent to + 48 per cent. In other words, REDgroupâs business performance was by far the worst of any of its peers that we traded with. And we had a relatively good year: in the critical JulyâDecember period, the sales of our titles by the book trade, as measured by Bookscan, rose by 7 per cent by value and by volume, while the invoice value of our âsalesâ to the trade fell by 7.5 per cent. (For an explanation of the difference between the two, see an earlier post on this blog, headed âSales, Returns, Reprints, and Bookscanâ.)

For the whole of 2009, it was obvious that REDgroupâs woes were causing serious damage to all publishers. Publishing being international, its troubles were known abroad, and were the subject of great consternation. Within our own company, if I was asked for my opinion on the subject, I would say that everyone except REDgroup itself would be better if they just went broke. Iâve since heard that other publishers had come to the same conclusion.

And yet, despite all this, PEP kept trying to exit their investment in the REDgroup by preparing it for a public flotation on the Australian Stock Exchange. If theyâd succeeded, it would have made the notorious 2009 Myer float by a fellow private-equity buccaneer, TPG, look like a responsible and well-priced endeavour.

And hereby lies the final cautionary tale, which the media doesnât want to know about: the demise of the REDgroup is a good example of how hopeless our business journalism is. As Iâve indicated, everybody and his dog in the industry knew that Borders/A&amp;R were in trouble. Yet no print journalist had the contacts or the wit to chase the story. Theyâve all become too used to regurgitating press releases and reporting media conferences, and even limiting that to stock-exchange-listed companies. Yet the REDgroup employed thousands of people, and their fate affects many other companies and individuals. If business journalists had been on the case, last weekâs announcement wouldnât have been such a shock â and people with vested interests wouldnât have got away with making wrong pronouncements about what it means.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Lesley JÃ¸rgensen, âCat &amp;amp; Fiddleâ (SA)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner-up&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Sally Bothroyd, âA Cocoa Jackson Mysteryâ (NT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly commended&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Courtney Collins, âThe Burialâ (NSW)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe Publications is pleased to announce the winner of the 2011 CAL Scribe Fiction Prize is &lt;em&gt;Cat &amp;amp; Fiddle&lt;/em&gt;, a multicultural saga focusing on two British families: the Muslim Chaudrys and the landowning Bournes. With a wry and ironic voice, JÃ¸rgensen follows the members of these two families as their lives overlap and ultimately collide at the country estate of Bourne Abbey in rural Wiltshire. The result is an impressive and multilayered portrayal of contemporary life, interracial love, and generational and cultural clashes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judges were Blanche Clark (Books Editor, &lt;em&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt;), Mark Rubbo (CEO of Readings Bookstores) and Aviva Tuffield (Associate Publisher, Fiction, Scribe Publications). Of the winning manuscript, judge Blanche Clark said: â&lt;em&gt;Cat &amp;amp; Fiddle&lt;/em&gt; is a humorous and insightful examination of a Bangladeshi family trying to maintain its traditional cultural and moderate Muslim practices in modern-day Britain. The generational conflicts are astutely drawn, and its lively pace and subtle sense of mockery make it an enjoyable read.â &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesley JÃ¸rgensen was born in 1964 and grew up in the Adelaide Hills. She trained as a Registered Nurse at the Childrenâs and Royal Adelaide hospitals while also completing simultaneous Arts and Law degrees. She has worked as a medical-negligence lawyer in Australia and England, and while in England she married into a Muslim Anglo-Bangladeshi family, then returned with her husband to live in Melbourne. Since 2007 she has been living in the small coastal town of Goolwa with her two children. There, she has been trying to write fiction in between working and raising a family. &lt;em&gt;Cat &amp;amp; Fiddle&lt;/em&gt; will be her first book and will be published in early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Joe Bageant died on 26 March 2011, in Virginia in the United States, after having been struck down by cancer several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Bageant was a well-loved political commentator, appearing frequently on US national public radio, the BBC, in documentary films and also writing for newspapers and magazines internationally.  His book &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/deerhuntingwithjesus1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deer Hunting with Jesus: dispatches from Americaâs class war&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was adapted for the theatre and is being developed as a dramatic television series in America.
Originally from Virginia, Bageant spent much of each year in Belize and Mexico, where he wrote, and in which he sponsored small health-and-shelter development projects. His online column (www.joebageant.com) made him a cult hero among gonzo-journalism junkies and progressives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe Publisher Henry Rosenbloom says: &amp;lsquo;Joe was a terrific person, a good friend, and a very fine writer. Our family, our publishing house, and the world at large will all miss him. Our thoughts and love go to his family and friends in this time of their grief&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe&amp;rsquo;s second book &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/rainbowpie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Pie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is released this week in the US, published by Scribe.&lt;/p&gt;

Scribe Publisher Henry Rosenbloom says: 'Joe was a terrific person, a good friend, and a very fine writer. Our family, our publishing house, and the world at large will all miss him. Our thoughts and love go to his family and friends in this time of their grief'.

Joe's second book [_Rainbow Pie_](http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/rainbowpie) is released this week in the US, published by Scribe. </content>

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe is saddened by the news that Hans Keilson passed away on May 31,
2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch-German author died at the age of 101 in
hospital in Holland. Hans Keilson was born in Germany but, following the
Nazisâ rise to power, was forced to move to the Netherlands before the
outbreak of World War II. An award-winning psychiatrist, he was particularly
renowned for specialising in the traumatic effects of the Holocaust on
Jewish survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keilson&amp;rsquo;s fiction was recently rediscovered when the &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
praised his work in 2010. Critic Francine Prose called Keilson a &amp;lsquo;genius&amp;rsquo;
and one of the worldâs best writers. She described his books &lt;em&gt;The Death of
the Adversary&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Comedy in a Minor Key&lt;/em&gt; as masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, on his 100th birthday, Mr Keilson was honoured as an Officer of
the Order of Orange-Nassau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe has just published &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/comedyinaminorkey"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comedy in a Minor
Key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We will be publishing two more of Keilsonâs books â his memoirs, and another of his novels, &lt;em&gt;Life Goes On&lt;/em&gt; â over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Weâve just done something that may be completely crazy: weâve moved into larger, swish, purpose-built new premises, (you can see some photos &lt;a href="http://www.dimasearchitects.com.au/dma/folio/scribe-publications"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) in the face of a book-industry recession. Thereâs never been a more trying time, in my experience, with pressure on every aspect of the industry around the English-speaking world. In Australia, these pressures are exacerbated by the high value of our currency, the preferential tax treatment given to offshore online booksellers, and by the high-interest-rate regime thatâs been imposed by our out-of-touch, incompetent central bank for almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why have we done this? Essentially, because weâd outgrown our previous premises, which functioned like a charming share-house; and given that we had to move, I wanted us to relocate to premises with facilities that would enable us to function at our best, and to grow when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâve finally got a meeting-room â and itâs being used for remarkably productive conversations. Weâve finally got private space for editors to think and work in. Weâve finally got modern workspaces that give staff the room to spread out. And I suspect that we also feel more grounded collectively, in the heart of Brunswick, a multicultural, vibrant, inner-city suburb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, weâve moved to within a block or so of the factory from which I ran our familyâs book-printing business, Globe Press, from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. Brunswick is now very different, but it feels like the right place to be, for me and for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâve found the move very moving, partly because â as it happens â Scribe has also just celebrated its 35th birthday. This marks 35 years of our existence as a home-grown, wholly independent trade-publishing house. I feel slightly weird about claiming this anniversary, as we published few books annually for the first 20-or-so years, but the fact is that we managed to survive and grow over that time, and in the process Iâm certain that weâve helped change the reality and the received opinion of what small-to-medium-sized publishers are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of developments that have especially pleased me in recent years. One has been our ability to pick very good overseas books on intrinsically difficult subjects and to manage to find a sizeable readership for them. (I am thinking here of books such as &lt;a href="www.scribepublications.com.au/book/deerhuntingwithjesus1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deer Hunting with Jesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Joe Bageant; &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thegoodsoldiers1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Soldiers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by David Finkel; and &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/everymaninthisvillageisaliar1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every Man in This Village is a Liar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Megan Stack.) We have competitors whoâve noticed this, and are trying to do the same thing; and although we could do without the implicit flattery, this can only benefit Australian readers and the culture in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is that itâs no longer the case that independent houses such as Scribe only attract small books by unknown or left-over authors that sell in small quantities â as we demonstrated, for example, with &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/thebrainthatchangesitself1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brain that Changes Itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Dr Norman Doidge (a Canadian popular-science title that has sold over 150,000 copies in three-and-a-half years), or &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/sideshow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sideshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Lindsay Tanner (a local politics/media title that sold over 10,000 copies in a few months earlier this year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe and its peers have shown many times that independent publishers can publish influential books that garner substantial publicity and achieve commercial success. The niche that we now occupy is defined by the quality of what we do, and not by its quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my continuing astonishment, what started off in 1976 as a desire on my part to publish âserious non-fictionâ on a limited scale has turned into a company with over a dozen staff members and two scouts that publishes 60â65 non-fiction and fiction titles each year. We are continually sifting through submissions and manuscripts from around the world, and commissioning and editing local titles, in an uncompromising pursuit of the best books we can find and help create. Many of our books have won or been shortlisted for major international and national literary awards, and our company has won the Small Publisher of the Year Award several times since its inception in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all these years, Iâm still drawn to non-fiction writers who have a good case to argue, who bring vital analyses of important subjects to new readers, or who offer fresh perspectives on old stories. Weâve got to the stage that we can virtually guarantee serious readers who are concerned about international and national affairs that we either have or will have a very good book on our list that deals with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With fiction, I love writers with verve and panache who have a distinctive voice and something compelling to reveal about the human condition. Aviva Tuffield, our associate publisher of fiction, is building a strong emerging local list that is gaining critical acclaim and commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can produce as many books as you like, but you canât manufacture your reputation. Iâve realised in the last few years that weâre well regarded by many people Iâve never spoken to or dealt with, and that theyâve been contributing silently to our success. So Iâd like to thank them, and everybody else whoâs helped us to last this long and to get to this stage in relatively good shape â especially our authors, our readers, our staff, our sales and distribution partners, our rights agents and scouts, the agents and publishers we buy rights from and sell rights to, our booksellers and media, our suppliers, and our friends and supporters in Australia and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I should acknowledge, as Iâve written before, that thereâs something deeply irrational about being a serious trade publisher â even in normal economic times. Itâs one of the few genuinely entrepreneurial activities left in the free market; but, paradoxically, it usually rewards high risk with low financial returns and deep anxiety. Itâs just that itâs something Iâve felt compelled to do. Iâm driven by a conviction that we have to provide a means for authors to tell the truth about what they see and what they know, and that we have to âcomfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortedâ. This is perhaps a bit prosecutorial for a publisher, but there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, weâll be refreshing and relaunching our branding and our website, and weâll be extending the reach of our e-books to every significant platform â including Apple, Amazon, and Google. In the worst of times, the best is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Iâve realised in the last few years that weâre well regarded by many people Iâve never spoken to or dealt with, and that theyâve been contributing silently to our success. So Iâd like to thank them, and everybody else whoâs helped us to last this long and to get to this stage in relatively good shape â especially our authors, our readers, our staff, our sales and distribution partners, our rights agents and scouts, the agents and publishers we buy rights from and sell rights to, our booksellers and media, our suppliers, and our friends and supporters in Australia and around the world.

Finally, I should acknowledge, as Iâve written before, that thereâs something deeply irrational about being a serious trade publisher â even in normal economic times. Itâs one of the few genuinely entrepreneurial activities left in the free market; but, paradoxically, it usually rewards high risk with low financial returns and deep anxiety. Itâs just that itâs something Iâve felt compelled to do. Iâm driven by a conviction that we have to provide a means for authors to tell the truth about what they see and what they know, and that we have to âcomfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortedâ. This is perhaps a bit prosecutorial for a publisher, but there you have it.

In the near future, weâll be refreshing and relaunching our branding and our website, and weâll be extending the reach of our e-books to every significant platform â including Apple, Amazon, and Google. In the worst of times, the best is yet to come.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;All of us at Scribe were deeply saddened to hear of the death of Diana Gribble, who passed away on 4 October, 2011, after a short illness. Di was &lt;a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/10/05/weve-lost-a-friend-and-publisher/"&gt;âan extraordinary figure in Australian publishing, culture and mediaâ&lt;/a&gt;, having been co-founder of McPhee Gribble Publishing, the Text Media Group, and online-publishing group Private Media (publisher of &lt;em&gt;Crikey&lt;/em&gt;, among other websites). She was greatly loved and admired, and has left a remarkable legacy in the hundreds of people who are fortunate enough to have lived and worked alongside her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe Publisher Henry Rosenbloom says: âDi was a wonderful person and a wonderful example to everyone involved in Australian publishing. She was a beacon of light for authors and publishers alike, and she will be greatly missed.â&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;From January 2012, Scribe will publish most of its trade paperbacks in B+ format (210 x 135 mm) rather than C format (234 x 153mm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribeâs CEO and publisher, Henry Rosenbloom says, âThis is a significant decision, which will enable us to lower the RRPs for most of our titles to under $30.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âI feel we have to do this to meet the market and try to help local booksellers as well. The continuing high Australian dollar, combined with fierce competition from offshore online booksellers that arenât subject to GST, has driven the Australian book trade into a profound slump â the worst Iâve known during my 35 years in the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âSomething has to give. We canât keep pumping out books at prices that seem high by international standards, and that consumers arenât prepared to pay. On the other hand, given our local costs, we canât just keep lowering our RRPs on the traditional trade paperback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âThe solution weâve come up with is to trim the format enough to lower our costs and prices, while still producing an attractive physical object that book buyers will appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âWeâll still produce C-format paperbacks occasionally, when itâs appropriate to do so, but essentially Iâve come to the view that, as a default format, itâs become a luxury that we â and the book trade â can no longer afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âIf the Australian dollar magically dropped to its long-term average and stayed there, and the Australian government did its duty over the GST, we would revisit this decision. But, for the foreseeable future, itâs, âBye bye, C.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âThis decision will create a flow-on benefit of lowering our e-book prices, too, which will become an increasingly important factor for us and the trade in general.â&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday 8 November, the Honourable Bob Carr, former Premier of NSW, will launch Troy Bramstonâs book &lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/lookingforthelightonthehill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for the Light on the Hill: modern Labor&amp;rsquo;s challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The event will be held at NSW Parliament House and MCâd by Rhys Muldoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A timely and necessary look at the situation of the ALP today, &lt;em&gt;Looking for the Light on the Hill&lt;/em&gt; argues that Labor is bedevilled by twin problems: the loss of its intrinsic culture of strong, bold, and innovative leadership; and an identity crisis that has emerged because Labor has failed to refresh its values, philosophy, and purpose for the modern era. Written by party insider and former Rudd government adviser Troy Bramston, the book draws on Laborâs history with fresh perspectives, and includes the secret components of the partyâs recent internal review. It also includes new interviews with former party leaders, current and former ministers, and union leaders and party figures â and reveals astonishing opinion-poll results, commissioned exclusively for this book, that demonstrate the depth of the crisis. Challenged by the Greens on the left and the Coalition on the right, Australiaâs oldest political party is in real trouble. &lt;em&gt;Looking for the Light on the Hill&lt;/em&gt; shows how Labor can get its mojo back with new policy ideas, a new political strategy, organisational reform, and a refreshing of the partyâs values.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The below is a response to this post on Bob Carr&amp;rsquo;s blog &lt;a href="http://bobcarrblog.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/the-price-of-books/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughtlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Bob&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were wrong then, and youâre wrong now. You were tendentious then, and youâre tendentious now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Book Industry Study Group (BISG) report is a serious, thoughtful, and informed attempt to deal with the challenges and problems facing the book industry. I donât agree with all of its recommendations, but it is a much more impressive report than either one produced by the Productivity Commission in 2009. It contains original research and fresh thinking, and your glib dismissal of it does you no credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And will you please refrain from misrepresenting me? I did not say that the book industry is in a profound slump solely because of non-GST-paying online competition. If you really want to know what I think about this, the problems also stem from a variety of other sources, including the high Australian dollar, high interest rates, the loss of the RedGroup chain with its 20+% of the market, and the general consumer caution that has been decimating retailers of most goods around the country. It is not the result of the maintenance of parallel-import restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your talk of âliberatingâ local bookshops is scary. Even after all the detailed explanations and arguments of people who understand the industry and care about it, you either donât realise or donât care that the end-result of your economically rationalist position is a publishing wasteland. Australia would go backwards 70 years or more, to the era of the Traditional Publishing Agreement, and would resume its position of very limited local publishing and colonial dependency. Ironically â or perhaps not â your argument, if accepted, would play into the hands of the biggest and nastiest corporations, both overseas and here, and the people it would hurt most would be local authors, independent booksellers, and independent publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current 30/90 day rule, or the proposed 14/14 revision of it, is not âinternationally and locally uncompetitiveâ. Parallel imports are banned in the US and the UK, and the UK often publishes books several months after they come out in the US. Our peculiar problem is that we are a small English-language market, exposed by the above factors in an economy that can never produce the economies of scale enjoyed by our larger competitors. And yet all this would be ameliorated with the dollar at its long-term average levels and a government that did its duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, maybe whatâs right and obvious to you stems from your lack of engagement with the fine detail and the underlying principles of whatâs going on and whatâs at stake. Even Laurie Oakes thinks that the government should remove the GST from books, and heâs as much of a hardhead as you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last point: you write scathingly of the report offering local printers âeven more subsidyâ. Even more than what? Iâm unaware of any special subsidy that book printers get, but I am aware that theyâre getting hammered by all of the above, as well as by some UK publishers paying them in pounds. Incidentally, I understand that some UK publishers may be avoiding GST through the use of sham offshore entities. But that would all be in the spirit of free-market competition with Australian independent publishers, wouldnât it, Bob?&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortlist for 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe Publications is delighted to announce the shortlist for this yearâs CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for writers 35 and over: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy Espeseth, &lt;em&gt;Trouble Telling the Weather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Andrew Lindsay, &lt;em&gt;Manly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hugo Wilcken, &lt;em&gt;The Reflection&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received 175 manuscripts in total from writers ranging in age from 35 to 85. This year, the prize money for the winner is $15,000 plus a book contract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shortlist now goes to the judges of this yearâs CAL Scribe Fiction Prize: Blanche Clark, Books Editor at the &lt;em&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt;; Jon Page, CEO of Pages &amp;amp; Pages Bookstore and President of the ABA; and Aviva Tuffield, Associate Publisher at Scribe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the prize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2009, Scribe launched the CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for an unpublished manuscript by an Australian writer aged 35 and over, regardless of publication history. Many writers only find the time and have acquired the life experience to write fiction later in life. This prize recognises that there are many examples of late bloomers when it comes to writers, certainly in terms of getting published. Youth is already celebrated in so many ways, and Scribe wants to support writers who are emerging or still going strong in their prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Scribeâs intention that this prize will raise the profile of Australian fiction, demonstrate our commitment to local authors, and find a wonderful new voice and/or novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the Copyright Agency Limitedâs Cultural Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the shortlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Amy Espeseth was awarded the Prize for an Unpublished Manuscript by an Emerging Victorian Writer in the 2009 Victorian Premierâs Literary Awards. Her fiction has appeared in various journals including &lt;em&gt;Wet Ink&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;antithesis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Death Mook&lt;/em&gt;. She received the Felix Meyer Award for Literature in 2007.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Trouble Telling the Weather&lt;/em&gt; unfolds through the viewpoint of five characters who share a difficult past. The pastoral beauty of their town is undermined by the racial, economic and social inequalities that refuse to remain buried beneath the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Lindsay is the author of &lt;em&gt;The Breadmakerâs Carnival&lt;/em&gt;, which won the Jim Hamilton Award, and &lt;em&gt;The Slapping Man&lt;/em&gt;, shortlisted for the FAW (Vic.) Christina Stead Award. He also won the Radio National &lt;em&gt;Books And Writing&lt;/em&gt; short-story competition, the 2008 Peter Blazey Fellowship and the 2009 National Jazz Writing Competition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Manly&lt;/em&gt; is a literary account of a teenage boy who is transported from his idyllic bushland childhood to the hostile environment of a boarding school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Wilcken was born in Sydney in 1964. He has recently returned to live there after 20 years in Paris, where he worked as a translator. He has published two novels and has written cultural criticism for the &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Frieze Magazine&lt;/em&gt; and other publications. &lt;br&gt;
A plot-driven meditation on identity, &lt;em&gt;The Reflection&lt;/em&gt; takes its cues from the mystery novel, but ultimately spins off into a quite different space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a slightly modified version of a talk I gave to introduce a session called âRights Trading: new knowledge, new practicesâ in Sydney on 29 November 2011, as part of a day-long industry seminar sponsored by the Australian Publishers Association called âThe Bu$iness of Digital Rightsâ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs hard to believe, but Amazon released its first Kindle in the United States just four years ago. Accordingly, the digital transformation of books in Australia has only been underway for a short while. Most local publishers, whether they were large or small, only needed to prepare for and engage with this transformation two years ago or less. As they did so, they had a number of key concerns that were complex and often inter-related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to try to understand the technical and practical challenges coming, and how their organisation could or should deal with them. This included questions of settling on e-book formats and platforms, the resources needed to convert print files so they would be available on them, and the workflow consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to deal with the commercial challenges. This included entering into contractual arrangements with authors and agents, and e-book retailers; e-book costing and pricing; and the level of investment necessary or even possible to do the job properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to deal with the strategic challenges. This included dealing with concerns about the security of their e-files; how much of their list to convert and when; and the likely effects on their business overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While they were wrestling with all of these matters, they all knew that they would not get back their investment of time and money in the foreseeable future. The Australian market was still very immature, with very few e-retailers of any size operating in it. At the same time, they knew they had to make that investment to be part of the future that was rushing toward them. Even today, Iâd be surprised if any Australian publisher has yet recouped its costs of going digital from its e-book sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although itâs been a rocky road, I think we can now say that the initial technical and commercial challenges have largely been met, as have some of the strategic challenges, but that the key commercial and strategic challenges remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ePub format has become the default e-book format internationally, and many e-book platforms now accept it. Publishers have, by and large, worked out how to go about the conversion process, and have adjusted their organisational structures to cope with the new work demands that flow from digitisation. There are still delays and quality-control problems with e-book conversion â which end up frustrating consumers â but publishers get what they pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial challenges have been immense, and under-appreciated outside the industry. For some time, it wasnât even clear whether existing publishing contracts included e-book rights; eventually, most publishers decided that it was in everybodyâs interests for them to expressly acquire electronic rights in their titles. This required contractual addenda to be drawn up for old agreements, and for the new clauses to be incorporated in new agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the matter of e-book royalties had to be thought through and negotiated. This was another version of âHow long is a piece of string?â Publishers have to relate the royalties they pay to retail prices and sales, but in the case of e-books this was mostly unknown and highly speculative. Eventually, led by US practice, most of the industry settled on a royalty of 25 per cent of nett receipts. Inevitably, this will be revisited once weâve all had enough real-world experience of the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âNett receiptsâ begs a question or two, of course. Itâs a function of list-price sales less trade discounts. But what price should e-books be? The experience of the US, which, because of Amazonâs entrenched position, led the world, was that they were very low in relation to print prices. Most Australian publishers have a much more conservative answer to this question, and priced their e-books initially at levels ranging from 80 per cent to 100 per cent of print-book prices. Partly, this was in recognition of the fact that they were incurring substantial extra costs to digitise their lists, with only the absence of print bills compensating for this. Partly, also, it was probably a recognition that they would rather start high and gradually move lower, than start low and have nowhere to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of ânett receiptsâ is the level of trade discounts that publishers provide. And here we come to the fact that dealing with e-book retailers has been the most trying commercial challenge of all. Of the international players, Kobo entered the scene first and relatively straightforwardly. But the big three, the so-called gorillas â Amazon, Apple, and Google â didnât even bother to talk to local publishers until relatively recently. Some consumers were unhappy about the lack of local e-book content, not realising it was because the content sellers hadnât bothered to deal with the content providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when discussions and negotiations did start, it was quickly apparent that there was a vast disparity in the resources available to the parties. Even the biggest trade publisher in the world is a minnow compared to, say, Amazon. Not surprisingly, publishers found that every clause of every draft agreement favoured the content sellers. Everything had to be thought through and negotiated â e-book pricing, discount terms, duration, etc. There were different models on offer. And there were also serious worries about possible infringements of trade-practices legislation, and the downward ratcheting effect of so-called âmost-favoured-nationâ clauses, whereby the major e-sellers insisted on never being disadvantaged on pricing, whatever the circumstances. This became a long and arduous process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I should add here that a number of local e-book vendors have since emerged, and that dealing with them has been pleasant and relatively straightforward. A couple of them â Booki.sh and ReadCloud â are offering much-needed solutions for local booksellers, and others provide solutions for school and public libraries.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most important of all, while wending their way through this labyrinth, publishers had to understand the likely effect of their decisions on the income that they and their authors would receive. Each deal was different, but each deal was related. Speaking purely for my own company, Scribe, we were determined that, on average, our authors would receive around the same income from an e-book sale that they would receive from a print-book sale. This was a complex combination of our e-book royalty rate applied to our e-book prices less our average e-book discount. The average discount we paid would vary, of course, depending on the market shares of our e-retailers. But we did everything we could to protect our authorsâ interests in this way. The result, at least for the time being, is that we and our authors can afford to be indifferent as to whether we sell books physically or electronically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with Iâve called the strategic challenges. Local publishers were initially worried about two things: piracy and cannibalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first has to do with the anxiety that once an electronic file has been made available on the Internet, it can be pirated and downloaded for free, undermining or even destroying its commercial value. This is meant to have been dealt with by a universally adopted tool called âDigital Rights Managementâ, or DRM, which limits the availability of an e-book file to the territory in which it has been licensed. DRM is usually insisted on in publishing agreements, and we all commit to it, whether as sellers or buyers. The trouble is, itâs not worth the paper itâs written on: anybody with any digital ability can crack a DRM file in about 20 seconds. This means that digital piracy is unavoidable and inevitable. Weâve lost this battle before itâs even begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âCannibalisationâ was the word we were all throwing around 18 months ago or so, worrying that each e-book sale would occur at the expense of a print-book sale. And with e-book prices much lower than print-book prices, this seemed a sure path to ruin. What has happened since, at least in the United States, is both more and less worrying: e-book sales are going through the roof, while p-book sales are going through the floor. Or, to put it more conventionally, trade sales of printed books, both in quantity and value, are declining by much more than e-book sales are rising. As a result, most trade publishersâ turnover is down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the first six month of this year, Penguin Groupâs worldwide operations were down 7 per cent, or 36 million pounds, compared with last year; within this figure, digital sales went up by 64 per cent, or 22 million pounds, while print sales went down 13 per cent, or 61 million pounds. In the same period, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster reported an overall decline of 1 per cent, even though digital sales increased by 115 per cent, or $30 million, because print sales declined by 10 per cent, or $33 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even given these turnover declines, both publishersâ operating margins improved. And a batch of recent financial reports from major US houses confirms that, despite the divergent print/digital sales trends, their profitability has increased. This can only mean one thing: the deals theyâve struck with e-book retailers are more lucrative than their print-book sales &amp;amp; distribution arrangements. How long the marketplace will accept this arrangement is anyoneâs guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we now have some answers to local publishersâ initial concerns, and theyâre not necessarily answers to our liking. But that still leaves us with what Iâve called âthe key commercial and strategic challengesâ. That is, most simply, how do we manage the transition from print to digital, stay in business in the meantime, and come out the other side, fit for purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is currently the most challenged book market in the world. (These are not my words, by the way â they were uttered spontaneously by John Makinson, the chairman and ceo of the Penguin Group, during a chance encounter we had at the recent Frankfurt Book Fair.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows the trouble weâre in: a high dollar that makes our book prices look high by US and UK standards; offshore online competition free of GST and duty, further enabled by subsidised international postage rates; a post-REDgroup market down by over 20 per cent; and consumers and consumer advocates now treating books like commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we have an additional problem to do with territorial e-rights thatâs just over the horizon: thereâs a small but discernible tendency for overseas publishers to demand world e-book rights, even when they donât have physical territorial rights (and theyâre trying to have their way with those, as well). This threatens to be the greatest of all our challenges: if we give in to, or lose, this battle, thereâll be no local publishing industry left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, having hacked our way through the e-book jungle, but with decent e-book sales still over the horizon, we have the worst of both worlds: an old business model that doesnât work well any more, and a new business model thatâs still a work in progress. We now have to turn that progress into achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On top of that, we have an additional problem to do with territorial e-rights thatâs just over the horizon: thereâs a small but discernible tendency for overseas publishers to demand world e-book rights, even when they donât have physical territorial rights (and theyâre trying to have their way with those, as well). This threatens to be the greatest of all our challenges: if we give in to, or lose, this battle, thereâll be no local publishing industry left.

At the moment, having hacked our way through the e-book jungle, but with decent e-book sales still over the horizon, we have the worst of both worlds: an old business model that doesnât work well any more, and a new business model thatâs still a work in progress. We now have to turn that progress into achievement.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe Publications is thrilled to announce that the winner of the 2012 CAL Scribe Fiction Prize for writers 35 and over is Amy Espeseth for âTrouble Telling the Weatherâ. Amy wins $15,000 and a book contract with Scribe. Amy Espesethâs âTrouble Telling the Weatherâ is a novel-in-stories that unfolds through the viewpoints of five characters who live in Siren, Wisconsin, and share a difficult past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judges were Blanche Clark (Books Editor, Herald Sun), Jon Page (CEO, Pages &amp;amp; Pages Bookstore, and President of the ABA) and Aviva Tuffield (Associate Publisher, Fiction, Scribe). Jon Page praised âTrouble Telling the Weatherâ as âan accomplished and absorbing story that follows a cast of interconnected characters with skill and empathyâ. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blanche Clark said: âAn assured tone and vivid descriptions bring to life the bleakness and beauty of Siren, Wisconsin, the setting for a poignant tale that compassionately, but unflinchingly, traverses the lives of five characters struggling with racial, economic and social disparity.â &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviva Tuffield added: âAmy Espeseth is such a talented and assured writer, and the links between these stories make âTrouble Telling the Weatherâ much more than the sum of its parts. Iâm very excited that Scribe will be publishing it.â &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two shortlisted manuscripts in this yearâs prize were âManlyâ by Andrew Lindsay and âThe Reflectionâ by Hugo Wilcken.
We received 175 manuscripts in total from writers ranging in age from 35 to 85. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Amy Espeseth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Amy Espeseth was born in rural Wisconsin and immigrated to Australia in the late 1990s. Her fiction has appeared in various journals including &lt;em&gt;Wet Ink&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;antithesis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Death Mook&lt;/em&gt;. She was awarded the Prize for an Unpublished Manuscript by an Emerging Victorian Writer in the 2009 Victorian Premierâs Literary Awards. She is also the recipient of yhe Felix Meyer Scholarship in Literature and the QUT Postgraduate Creative Writing Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;It is 1919. The Great War has ended, but the Spanish flu epidemic is raging across Australia. Schools are closed, state borders are guarded by armed men, and train travel is severely restricted. There are rumours it is the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the NSW town of Flint, Quinn Walker returns to the home he fled ten years earlier when he was accused of an unspeakable crime. Aware that his father and uncle would surely hang him, Quinn hides in the hills surrounding Flint. There, he meets the orphan Sadie Fox â a mysterious young girl who seems to know more about the crime than she should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A searing gothic novel of love, longing and justice, &lt;em&gt;Bereft&lt;/em&gt; is about the suffering endured by those who go to war and those who are forever left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

There, he meets the orphan Sadie Fox â a mysterious young girl who seems to know more about the crime than she should. 

A searing gothic novel of love, longing and justice, *Bereft* is about the suffering endured by those who go to war and those who are forever left behind.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;If youâre an independent bookseller in Australia at the moment, you probably feel better than anyone else in the industry does. Business is up, as a result of less competition following the collapse of Borders and Angus &amp;amp; Robertson. Book prices are down, as a result of the high Australian dollar and publishers capitulating to offshore competition and the weak economy, so your customers are getting much better value for money. There are even some signs that customers are rediscovering the special pleasures and benefits that only a physical bookshop can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, youâre probably worried that e-book sales are rising rapidly, and that youâre going to miss out on most of this market. Youâre still hurting from offshore online booksellers who donât have to pay GST or customs duties, or whose subsidised postal costs are unavailable to you. You also have to work harder than ever before, because lower average book prices mean you have to sell more books just to stand still. And you might also be worried about the growing rumours that Amazon is planning to set up in this country; if that comes to pass anytime soon, it will represent an existential threat to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a book-buyer working for one of the big chains or department stores, youâre probably dreaming of a promotion to the meat products section. Or else youâve got plans to treat books like salami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a literary agent, youâre probably worried about where your next dollar is going to come from. Advances from publishers are coming down across the board (especially from the big houses, which is where most of your income comes from), so thereâs less money for your authors and your business to survive on until each book is published. Youâre anxious about e-book royalty-rates, because you have to license them without knowing if theyâre reasonable or not. And, given the overseas trend for the acquisition of world rights, youâre finding it harder to justify your existence as a local agent. Itâs almost back-to-the-future time, when it makes more sense for a commercial Australian author to be published in London or New York than Melbourne or Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre an author, your prospects depend on the areas you work in. Paradoxically, if your work is marketable, you have a good chance of getting a local publishing deal â because, in publishersâ eyes, thereâs now a premium on local books that donât or wonât suffer from offshore competition. But, for authors of mid-list books (that is, books with fair-to-middling commercial prospects), advances will be lower than theyâve been, and will trend lower. And authors with a poor or faltering track record of sales as reported by Bookscan will find it harder to find publishers prepared to back them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a book printer, youâre struggling with unprecedented simultaneous problems. Print runs are down, reprints are down (and smaller), and value-adding cover embellishments are down. You canât raise your prices, and publishers are demanding impossible levels of service. Youâve cut shifts, and youâve retrenched staff. The one area thatâs booming is digital â print-on-demand titles and short-run digital reprints â but itâs cannibalising your conventional business. In essence, youâre an Australian manufacturer facing global headwinds. How do you make a profit in this environment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a book publisher, youâve got the blues real bad. Turnover is down dramatically; in fact, itâs fallen over a cliff. The value of bookshop sales, as measured by Bookscan, dropped by 17.5% in December last year, compared with the same period in 2010. This already-alarming trend was being maintained earlier this year, but it has just started to accelerate: in the second week of February 2012, the value of book-trade sales was 22 per cent lower than for the same week a year before; in the third week, the value was down 29 per cent. The first three weeks combined were down by 21.5 per cent. Publishers are hoping that this is the tail-end effect of the Borders and Angus &amp;amp; Robertson collapse. But what if itâs not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-books sales have risen significantly throughout this recent period, but theyâre not even close in value to the loss of turnover from what will soon be called p-book sales. Throughout this period, most publishersâ costs have been either roughly the same as a year before, or slightly higher. You donât need to be Einstein to work out the effect this has on profitability and cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a big publisher â a subsidiary of the multinational Big Six â youâre probably in a world of acute pain. Youâre haemorrhaging money and missing budgets, morale is shot, and youâre under excruciating pressure from head office to fix the problem. But how do you cut costs in a major way without abandoning core functions? The only solution is commercial success: you have to have a runaway bestseller now, and the next month, and the month after that. But you can only achieve that, usually, if you pay a lot of money for it. And yet costs have to come down. The only way you can square this circle is to have immaculate judgement: you have to be right every time you place a big bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâre a small or medium-sized publisher, you face a smaller version of the same set of problems. At least you manage your own business, you have less at risk, and youâre more flexible. But it takes steady nerves, a disciplined approach, excellent staff, and â again â inspired judgement to cope. And look on the bright side: you wonât have to pay company tax for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Australian industries and businesses are facing the same sort of severe challenges â although the arts, in general, seem to be regarded as economically irrelevant and not worth the governmentâs time or trouble. Ultimately, these problems are due to the high dollar, the power of the mining lobby, the stupidity of the Reserve Bank, and the complete subservience of Canberra and the financial commentariat to the rule of the marketplace (except when industries are politically influential). What will it take to change this hands-off approach? Nothing short of mass unemployment seems likely to shake the faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
UPDATE: The decline in book-trade sales as measured by Bookscan has continued to accelerate. In the fourth week of February, the value was down by 29.3 per cent; for the four weeks of the month, the value of sales was down by 23.5 per cent.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/news-and-events/post/book-trade-blues/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about the travails of the Australian book trade, as measured by the value of bookshop sales up to the end of February 2012. When I was at the London book fair recently, several people expressed shock at the size of the drop, and asked me whether thereâd been any improvement. I had the unfortunate duty of telling them that things had got worse. Bookscan figures since that post have revealed that the value of book-trade sales dropped even further in March and April, to be down by over 25 per cent. (There are signs in the first three weeks of May that the decline has started to moderate, to below 20 per cent, presumably because the effects of the collapse of Borders and Angus &amp;amp; Robertson have started to wash through the comparable 2011 figures.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other Australian industries are suffering severely, and itâs occurred to me that it might be useful to widen the lens a little, and look at whatâs been happening to a related industry â our metropolitan press. Circulation figures have recently been released for the period ending 31 March 2012, and they show a significant decline compared to a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are provisos, of course â &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; have stopped reporting giveaways and unprofitable sales, and all papers are showing significant online readerships. Nevertheless, some of the drops are jaw-dropping: both of the above papers are down by around 13 per cent, and even News Ltdâs tabloid papers keep losing readers. For the country as a whole, the circulation of metropolitan and regional dailies dropped by 5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even this, however, masks the extent of the problem. Most people know that newspapers have been enduring declining sales for some time, but I doubt that the severity of that decline is well known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I wrote a short book in 1976, called &lt;em&gt;Politics and the Media&lt;/em&gt;. (It was Scribeâs first book. In case youâre wondering, it went through several editions and printings.) Included in the 1978 edition was a table of circulation figures for our metropolitan press as of 30 September 1977 â 35 years ago. Fortuitously, this enables me to tell a before-and-after story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a selection of those figures, based on Monday-to-Saturday sales, and ranked by size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; (Melbourne):                  622,562&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Herald&lt;/em&gt; (Melbourne):       435,644&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; (Sydney):     316,417&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt; (Brisbane):          271,880&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;:        263,746&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The West Australian&lt;/em&gt; (Perth):      248,417&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Advertiser&lt;/em&gt; (Adelaide):        236,813&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; (Melbourne):          236,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures for our two national dailies were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;:           118,087&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review&lt;/em&gt;:  47,605&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a lot has happened in the intervening 35 years. In the newspaper industry, Rupert Murdoch was allowed to buy the Herald and Weekly Times Group, and therefore to end up with around 70 per cent of newspaper circulation. Afterwards, he merged Melbourneâs morning paper, &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;, with its afternoon paper, &lt;em&gt;The Herald&lt;/em&gt;, to create &lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt;. This means that itâs not possible to make direct sales comparisons of those entities; but, for the purposes of this post, and given that &lt;em&gt;The Herald&lt;/em&gt; was declining rapidly (as were all afternoon papers), &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;âs figures might as well be compared to the &lt;em&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt;âs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday papers also disappeared and emerged in different states, so I have ignored them for the purposes of this discussion. As well, circulation figures are now broken down into weekly and Saturday-only figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wider economy, the economic liberalisation and de-regulation fervour of the 1980s meant that the financial sector became much more prominent. This, in turn, led to the emergence of a business press that flourished for some time; in the process, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Review&lt;/em&gt;âs sales increased steadily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these caveats, here is the story today. As well as supplying the Monday-to-Friday figures, I have taken the extra step of producing the Monday-to-Saturday figures, as that is what was done 35 years ago, and it enables a direct comparison to be made. (For those who are interested, I checked first with the Audit Bureau, and was advised that the right way to do this is to multiply the MondayâFriday figure by five, add it to the Saturday figure, and divide the total by six.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):           469,377&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; (S):           472,047&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):         469,822&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):      336,348&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; (S):          327,447&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):        334,865&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):         187,897&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt; (S):         255,520&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):           199,168&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):    180,960&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; (S):        293,234&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):  199,672&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Australian&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):          179,824&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The West Australian&lt;/em&gt; (S):          314,568&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Australian&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):            202,281&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Advertiser&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):           176,102&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Advertiser&lt;/em&gt; (S):               235,830&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Advertiser&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):             186,057&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):              165,061&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; (S):                  241,029&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):                177,722&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures for our two national dailies were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):           127,942&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; (S):               290,323&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):         155,006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review&lt;/em&gt; (MâF):        70,518&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review&lt;/em&gt; (S):        69,057&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review&lt;/em&gt; (MâS):      70,275&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the difference for each of the above newspapers, expressed in percentage terms, over the 35 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt;:           -24.5 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;:           +5.8 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt;:         -26.7 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;:        -24.3 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The West Australian&lt;/em&gt;:          -18.6 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Advertiser&lt;/em&gt;:           -21.4 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;:              -24.7 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;:                 +31.3 per cent&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Australian Financial Review&lt;/em&gt;:    +48.6 per cent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As bad as these figures are for most newspapers, even they mask the size of the real problem. In 1977, Australiaâs population was around 14 million; in 2012, it is around 22 million â an increase of 57 per cent. This means that, just to keep pace with population growth, newspaper circulations needed to increase by 57 per cent over those 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, the apparent drop in &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;âs circulation of 25 per cent was a real drop of 82 per cent. The apparent rise of 6 per cent for &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; was a real drop of 51 per cent. Even the apparent rise of 31 per cent for &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; was a real drop of 26 per cent. (Itâs notable that these two Murdoch-owned newspapers have done so well, relatively.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that online readership has reduced the importance of these declines, and thatâs true as far as it goes. But online readership is a relatively recent development, itâs only one-twelfth the size of print sales, and it garners nowhere near the revenue of print sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also be argued that the newspapers bear a considerable responsibility for their own problems â especially because theyâve become so lightweight and cynical over the years in their coverage of events. But this is a chicken-and-egg argument: their managers and journalists would say that theyâve been responding to consumers, and their consumers would say that theyâve been responding to the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasons and qualifications, these figures add up to a catastrophic collapse in sales and revenues for most of the nationâs metropolitan newspapers. This is not sustainable, so thereâll clearly be major changes ahead. The Fairfax group, in particular, canât possibly keep going the way it is. For years, thereâs been scuttlebutt that theyâre planning to drop their print editions completely, and I suspect that this is true. But even this might not save them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deeper problem, of course, is what happens to civil society when major outlets for serious journalism wither or disappear. This is not a hole that &lt;em&gt;Crikey&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Monthly&lt;/em&gt; can fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final, eerie point: the drop in newspaper sales is very similar to (although not as bad as) the drop in the sales value of printed books over the same period. Thirty-five years ago, even a small publisher could expect to sell 3,000 hardback copies of any given book, and then around 5,000 paperback copies. Today, the average print-run is close to 2,000 copies (in paperback), and total sales of 5,000 would be considered a triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similarity does not end there. Sales of e-books are rising rapidly, to the point where theyâre probably over 15 per cent of revenues from p-books for most publishers. But the drop in value of p-book sales is much greater than the rise in value of e-book sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both print-legacy industries â newspapers and books â are facing similar problems for similar reasons, simultaneously. Both hope that digital developments will save them. And both donât know if theyâre right.&lt;/p&gt;

(For those who are interested, I checked first with the Audit Bureau, and was advised that the right way to do this is to multiply the MondayâFriday figure by five, add it to the Saturday figure, and divide the total by six.)

*The Herald Sun* (MâF):			469,377  
*The Herald Sun* (S):			472,047  
***The Herald Sun* (MâS):			469,822**  

*The Daily Telegraph* (MâF): 		336,348  
*The Daily Telegraph* (S):	 		327,447  
***The Daily Telegraph* (MâS): 		334,865**  

*The Courier-Mail* (MâF):			187,897  
*The Courier-Mail* (S):			255,520  
***The Courier-Mail* (MâS):			199,168**  

*The Sydney Morning Herald* (MâF):	180,960  
*The Sydney Morning Herald* (S):		293,234  
***The Sydney Morning Herald* (MâS):	199,672**  

*The West Australian* (MâF):			179,824  
*The West Australian* (S): 			314,568  
***The West Australian* (MâS):			202,281**  

*The Advertiser* (MâF): 			176,102  
*The Advertiser* (S): 				235,830  
***The Advertiser* (MâS): 			186,057**  

*The Age* (MâF):				165,061  
*The Age* (S):					241,029  
***The Age* (MâS):				177,722**  

The figures for our two national dailies were:

*The Australian* (MâF):			127,942  
*The Australian* (S):				290,323  
***The Australian* (MâS):			155,006**  

*The Australian Financial Review* (MâF):  	  70,518  
*The Australian Financial Review* (S):	 	  69,057  
***The Australian Financial Review* (MâS): 	  70,275**  

Here is the difference for each of the above newspapers, expressed in percentage terms, over the 35 years:

*The Herald Sun*:			-24.5 per cent  
*The Daily Telegraph*: 			 +5.8 per cent  
*The Courier-Mail*:			-26.7 per cent  
*The Sydney Morning Herald*:		-24.3 per cent  
*The West Australian*:			-18.6 per cent  
*The Advertiser*:			-21.4 per cent  
*The Age*:				-24.7 per cent  
*The Australian*:		          +31.3 per cent  
*The Australian Financial Review*:    +48.6 per cent  

As bad as these figures are for most newspapers, even they mask the size of the real problem. In 1977, Australiaâs population was around 14 million; in 2012, it is around 22 million â an increase of 57 per cent. This means that, just to keep pace with population growth, newspaper circulations needed to increase by 57 per cent over those 35 years.

To put it another way, the apparent drop in *The Age*âs circulation of 25 per cent was a real drop of 82 per cent. The apparent rise of 6 per cent for *The Daily Telegraph* was a real drop of 51 per cent. Even the apparent rise of 31 per cent for *The Australian* was a real drop of 26 per cent. (Itâs notable that these two Murdoch-owned newspapers have done so well, relatively.)

It could be argued that online readership has reduced the importance of these declines, and thatâs true as far as it goes. But online readership is a relatively recent development, itâs only one-twelfth the size of print sales, and it garners nowhere near the revenue of print sales.

It could also be argued that the newspapers bear a considerable responsibility for their own problems â especially because theyâve become so lightweight and cynical over the years in their coverage of events. But this is a chicken-and-egg argument: their managers and journalists would say that theyâve been responding to consumers, and their consumers would say that theyâve been responding to the product.

Whatever the reasons and qualifications, these figures add up to a catastrophic collapse in sales and revenues for most of the nationâs metropolitan newspapers. This is not sustainable, so thereâll clearly be major changes ahead. The Fairfax group, in particular, canât possibly keep going the way it is. For years, thereâs been scuttlebutt that theyâre planning to drop their print editions completely, and I suspect that this is true. But even this might not save them.

The deeper problem, of course, is what happens to civil society when major outlets for serious journalism wither or disappear. This is not a hole that *Crikey* or *The Monthly* can fill.

One final, eerie point: the drop in newspaper sales is very similar to (although not as bad as) the drop in the sales value of printed books over the same period. Thirty-five years ago, even a small publisher could expect to sell 3,000 hardback copies of any given book, and then around 5,000 paperback copies. Today, the average print-run is close to 2,000 copies (in paperback), and total sales of 5,000 would be considered a triumph.

The similarity does not end there. Sales of e-books are rising rapidly, to the point where theyâre probably over 15 per cent of revenues from p-books for most publishers. But the drop in value of p-book sales is much greater than the rise in value of e-book sales.

Both print-legacy industries â newspapers and books â are facing similar problems for similar reasons, simultaneously. Both hope that digital developments will save them. And both donât know if theyâre right.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Thereâs a dirty little secret at the heart of trade publishing, and it has nothing to do with sex. Itâs called editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editing covers a wide range of activities, but essentially itâs aimed at using the full resources of language to realise the best book possible out of the manuscript delivered by the author. Whether itâs a first draft or a twentieth, and whether itâs at a deep, structural level or at a surface level, most manuscripts arrive with some embedded problems needing serious editorial attention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems are legion, and they donât just comprise the obvious candidates of faulty grammar, syntax, and spelling, or redundancy, repetition, and tautology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most manuscripts also come with more deep-seated, pervasive problems, such as the excessive use of adjectives and adverbs; overuse of the passive voice; reliance on repeated phrases and clichÃ©s; underuse or misuse of punctuation tools; staccato or too-short sentences needing bridging and linking; prolix or circumlocutory sentences needing radical surgery; paragraphs that are too long or too short; inconsistent or wrong tenses; continuity and chronology errors; and even authorial explanations that are unnecessary or in the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to mention narrative denouements that are too forced or too slick, characterisations that are too thin, dialogue that is too undifferentiated, narrative details that are unnecessary or pointless, and plot points that are too instrumental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, these are accepted manuscripts Iâm talking about â accepted on the basis of a proposal, or sample chapters, or maybe an entire first draft. You can imagine what rejected manuscripts are like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on â a lot â but you get the idea. High-level editing requires an array of high-level skills, and the authorâeditor relationship has to be an intimate one. Perhaps surprisingly, given the litany of troubles Iâve just enumerated, the relationship is usually conducted with civility and, often, genuine personal warmth and friendship. Most editors are happy to deploy their skills for authors whose work they admire and respect. And most authors appreciate the dedicated, concentrated effort that is put at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strange thing, though, is that none of this is meant to be public knowledge. The editor is an invisible aide to the writer â the details of his or her intervention in a given manuscript are never revealed. You can understand why: no self-respecting author is going to publicly acknowledge (let alone admit) that he or she needs a considerable amount of help with their use of language. And no editor or publisher is going to big-note themselves at the expense of their authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that is why thereâs a paradox of public perception about the finished product. Itâs not uncommon, when obvious writing errors sneak through to a finished book, to read a reviewerâs comment that a particular author has been ill served by her editor, proofreader, or publisher. Itâs worth parsing this comment. The clear implication is that the errors are not the authorâs fault; instead, itâs the publisherâs responsibility to produce a linguistically clean work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, most serious publishers think the same, and feel hurt if such errors are pointed out â and may even be critical of other publishers if that criticism is made of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that everybody has internalised the editorâs role, without ever acknowledging the contingencies it has to deal with. Nobody outside the publishing house knows the challenges that were presented by a given manuscript, and nobody knows how much or what it did to help improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this doesnât even deal with financial imperatives â the fact that, for many publishers, especially in this climate, thereâs a limit to how much editing is affordable, or even rational to undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So editors are regarded as essential, even though no outsiders know what they do. And authors are regarded as innocent of their own misdeeds, even though this is a logically impossible position to uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is made even more poignant by the emergence of self-publishing authors, especially when they publish e-books. Many of these books are either not edited or edited amateurishly, so they display the faults listed above. But some of them sell very well (and are then adopted by conventional publishers), with very little concern being expressed about their technical inadequacies. Maybe, ironically, thereâs an implicit recognition that you canât expect self-published authors to write well or correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more bizarrely, the mainstream media pays less attention to editing than its impoverished book-publishing cousins do. Whether itâs because of the outsourcing of sub-editing, or because editorial managers donât know any better, or donât care, or donât have the time to think about it, itâs become noticeable how shoddy the use of language has become in our major newspapers and their websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find examples of this every day without even trying. Hereâs a recent couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt;âs website, under a news item headed âTrials of a parentâ, was the following caption. Understand (and correct) it, if you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The very public falling out of a British cabinet ministerâs bodybuilding-obsessed son with his family.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the front page of the business section of the &lt;em&gt;Weekend Australian&lt;/em&gt;, here is a carefully but wrongly punctuated heading above a story about Gina Rinehartâs supporters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ginaâs small, but loyal army&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example is simply impossible to follow because of a misplaced clause; the second is clear in its meaning (apart from an inadvertent down-sizing of the squillionaire), but completely confused in its execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does any of this matter? At one level, it doesnât. As long as readers get the idea of whatâs being communicated, close enough is good enough. At another level, it matters very much. If professional users of the language are sloppy or wrong, everybody else will either know no better or think that theyâre being given models to follow. And if our use of language falls apart, thinking and feeling will as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, itâs noticeable how many comments on websites and blogs are functionally illiterate â full of atrocious mis-spellings, non-existent punctuation, and grammatical absurdities. Often, these comments are full of bile and rage, as well. Thereâs a connection here, although itâs not an obvious one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that purifying âthe dialect of the tribeâ has become a radically conservative thing to do. Paradoxically, for an intrinsically liberal medium of communication, book publishing has to be reactionary about language. Imposing editing rules and house styles flies in the face of instant everything â instant celebrity, instant news, instant gratification. It involves hard and invisible work, and thereâs no obvious payoff for it. And yet, if you work at a serious publishing house, you have to do it, as well as you can and for as long as it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if trade publishers donât think thereâs a vital difference between good expression and poor expression, theyâre effectively saying that thereâs no difference between good writers and bad ones, or good ideas and bad ones, or good books and bad ones. And if publishers come to believe this, or act as though they do, they will have abandoned the core reason for their existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they have to keep quiet about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;For those of you reading this from overseas, give up now. None of it will make any sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many people know that Iâm a Collingwood supporter. The truth is, even if they knew, they wouldnât care. Or if they cared, it would only confirm their bad opinion of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs a fact universally understood (at least within Australia) that Collingwood is a despicable football club and that their supporters are all low-life scum. Even many football commentators donât try to hide their sadness or bitterness when the side is doing well, or their pleasure when the side is being beaten or challenged on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I donât know why this is. I do know, though, that it has nothing do with the supposed specially vile quality of Collingwood or its fans. In fact, given that the mental age of most vocal football fans seems to be about half that of room temperature at any time, itâs probably got a lot to do with the outlook of many eight-year-olds. It also has to do with most peopleâs need for a hate object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâm not saying that Collingwoodâs fans are universally charming; I just donât think theyâre universally appalling. As for the side itself, itâs been playing an exciting, attacking, disciplined style of football for several seasons; its players are rarely reported for rough play; itâs been in the finals for years on end (and won the premiership in 2010); and last year one of its players won the competitionâs best-and-fairest award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectively, Collingwood represents a lot of what is best about Australian Rules football. Subjectively, it shows a lot of what is worst about it. Every Pies-hater seems to harbour a race-memory of some piece of dreadful behaviour by a Pies fan twenty years ago, and to have no knowledge of similar behaviour by fans of other clubs â or even their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Magpies man, through thick and through thin, means putting up with a lot. If youâve been a fan long enough, you not only know that youâve been hated forever, but you remember many lost grand finals, and you come to every new season hoping for the best but fearing the worst. Itâs a heavy existential burden to deal with, not unlike supporting the Australian Labor Party (but thatâs another story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me, musing about all of the above, that those few football supporters who have a half-open mind and who chance on this blog might be interested to know how a Collingwood supporter looks at football when his side isnât playing. It might offer an insight into a closed world â or it might reveal surprising similarities to your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these are my viewing or listening rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an interstate side is playing a Victorian side, always support the Victorian side (with the possible exception of Carlton).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When two interstate sides are playing each other, donât watch or listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always support the sides playing Carlton and Essendon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Carlton is playing Essendon, support Essendon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always support the better side, except when that side is Carlton, Essendon, or Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never support Richmond, except in the case of rule #3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always support Geelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donât expect week-to-week consistency from the umpires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donât expect to understand any of the TV commercials; youâre the wrong demographic for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever wins, the AFL is manipulating the competition to suit its corporate agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To an uninvolved observer, this may seem an over-elaborate or perhaps even irrational framework of support and hostility, but to me itâs internally consistent and deals with the world as it is. I could provide footnotes, incorporating historical justifications (some of which go back 40 years or more), but whatâs the point? You either understand this &lt;em&gt;weltanshauung&lt;/em&gt;, or you donât.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even have strong suspicions that many non-Collingwood or anti-Collingwood fans have a similar belief system, in which only some details are different. Itâs a great comfort to always know what to think and how to feel, week in and week out, as an endless series of games between sides you have no interest in occupy the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other leisure time, you can always read books. But that, as we know, requires intense concentration and an open mind. And thatâs not so easy to commit to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe is to delighted to announce that it has signed Martin McKenzie-Murray to write a book about an apparently purposeless murder that occurred in Australia several years ago. The book, to be called &lt;em&gt;A Murder Without Motive&lt;/em&gt;, is slated for publication in 2014. The work will be an account of the authorâs search for a motive, amongst the suburbs, schools, injured families, prisons, and courts that were involved in the case. It will also be an examination of how different institutions of justice â from detectives to lawyers to psychologists â make their work meaningful, and of the faultlines that exist between each.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin is a regular columnist forÂ &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;, and runs his own blog,Â &lt;em&gt;Feeding the Chooks&lt;/em&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;

It will also be an examination of how different institutions of justice â from detectives to lawyers to psychologists â make their work meaningful, and of the faultlines that exist between each.Â 

Martin is a regular columnist forÂ *The Age*, and runs his own blog,Â *Feeding the Chooks*.Â

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Ruth and her cousin Naomi live in rural Wisconsin, part of an isolated religious community. The girlsâ lives are ruled by the rhythms of nature â the harsh winters, the hunting seasons, the harvesting of crops â and by their familiesâ beliefs. Beneath the surface of this closed, frozen world, hidden dangers lurk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Ruth learns that Naomi harbours a terrible secret. She searches for solace in the mysteries of the natural world: broken fawns, migrating birds, and the strange fish deep beneath the ice. Can the girlsâ prayers for deliverance be answered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sufficient Grace&lt;/em&gt; is a story of lost innocence and the unfailing bond between two young women. It is at once devastating and beautiful, and ultimately transcendent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;At forty-nine, Celeste has long renounced the religion of her childhood. Yet she finds herself reluctantly accompanying her mother and sister to a pilgrimage site in Romania, where her devout mother seeks a miracle &amp;#8212; a cure for her terminal illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Celeste tries to come to terms with her mother&amp;#8217;s impending decline, she realises she has to confront the unspoken conflicts buried in the foundations of her family. Away from her husband, she must also face her fear of what the future holds for them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full of compassion, warmth and grace, &lt;em&gt;Pilgrimage&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful meditation on how our personal histories haunt us, and an affirmation of the hope and sustenance that may be found in our imperfect families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Marie King is fifty-nine, recently divorced, and has lived a rather conventional life on Sydneyâs affluent north shore. Now her three children have moved out, the family home is to be sold, and with it will go her beloved garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a drunken whim, Marie gets a tattoo â an act that gives way to an unexpected friendship with her tattoo artist, Rhys. Before long, Rhys has introduced Marie to a side of the city that clashes with her staid north-shore milieu. Her children are mortified by their motherâs transformation, but have their own challenges to deal with: workplace politics; love affairs old and new; and, of course, the real-estate market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written with Fiona McGregorâs incisive wit and keen eye, &lt;em&gt;Indelible Ink&lt;/em&gt; uses one family as a microcosm for the changes operating in society at large. In its piercing examination of the way we live now, it is truly a novel for our times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the Jordan children â Petra, Isaak and Paul â can feel it coming, shaking the edges of their privileged, protected expat world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, Diana, an Australian development worker, moves to Jakarta and becomes entwined in the powerful Jordansâ adult lives. As the monsoon descends, and the Jordans begin to fall apart, Diana sinks into the half-light of their past, where rumour and religion define the contours of the real, and the rules of the game change according to who is playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in a global city of poverty, beauty, corruption and extreme wealth, &lt;em&gt;Running Dogs&lt;/em&gt; is a novel about power and responsibility; about the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive, and the damage they can do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;In the spirited tradition of Louis Theroux, Jeff Sparrow sets out to explore the relationship between porn and censorship, and what it reveals about our social values. From the internet revolution to raunch culture, Sparrowâs quest takes him through contemporary Australia: the sparkly booths of Sexpo; grimy adult cinemas; the loud, pro-virginity rallies of Pentecostal youth groups; and the depths of the Australian desert, where the Intervention has led to prohibitive restrictions in Indigenous communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Sparrow interviews some key figures, from religious lobbyists and porn stars to feminist activists, convicted pornographers, and those on the censorship board â who spend their days watching porn to evaluate what âthe average personâ would think of it. Through their stories, he uncovers the hypocrisies and blind spots in a system that seeks to encapsulate the communityâs views, but endorses cultural and social prejudices in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time of fervour and moral panic, when old divisions between Right and Left are breaking down, &lt;em&gt;Money Shot&lt;/em&gt; probes the contradictions of our relationship to sex and censure, excess and folly, erotica and vice. By turns moving, enlightening, and terrifically funny, it will show you a new side to the debate about censorship â whatever your views.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The âmergerâ of Penguin and Random House is, like all such deals, a takeover by another name. In this case, itâs a slow-motion takeover (it will take three or five years to be completed, depending on circumstances), after which either side can buy out the other. But given that it was Penguinâs owner, Pearson, that put its UK subsidiary on the block, and that Bertelsmann, Random Houseâs owner, starts off with 53 per cent of the merged entity, I agree with my friend Andrew Franklin, the founder and managing director of Profile, that, âItâs a racing certainty that the UK holding will be bought out by the deeper pockets of the richer German company.â (See his comments &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/and-so-i-bid-penguin-a-sad-farewell-8231433.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial question is, âWhy has this happened?â Thereâs been a lot of company spin about it enhancing service levels and enriching content, and thereâs been external commentary that, with around 25 per cent of the world trade-publishing market, Penguin and Random House will be able to better withstand the bullying behaviour of the major e-book retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think both of these are smokescreens. Amazon would certainly find it harder to turn off the buy-buttons of a Penguin House, but all the trade publishers in the world stacked end to end wouldnât put a dent in Amazonâs side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs much more relevant, I think, that Pearson has been under pressure from the financial markets for a long time to offload Penguin, and itâs been to its credit that itâs withstood these urgings. But the underlying reality is that trade publishing is a relatively slow-moving, low-profit business, and one that will be under enormous pressure for the foreseeable future. In the transition to digital publishing, with bricks-and-mortar outlets disappearing and physical turnover stalling or declining, the large houses are in a world of pain with their massive overhead costs and working-capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their owners have to do something about this, and their options boil down to exiting the industry, managing decline, or expanding: that is, they can sell out; reduce their lists, their costs, and their turnover, by dropping imprints and shedding functions and staff; or they can seek economies of scale by taking over a competitor. In Pearsonâs case, they clearly decided that they didnât have the corporate will or the patient capital necessary to persevere. They seem to have felt that their best solution was to find a new owner for Penguin that would feel appropriate, and to disguise their abandonment of the business as gracefully as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits for Bertelsmann are clear. They acquire a former competitor with wonderful lists, and immediately get the economies of scale from bulking up: jobs (and therefore costs) will quickly go in the physical handling of books, and in back-office functions, and thereâll be further ârationalisationâ down the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions that follow this decision are more important and interesting. What happens next to their competitors, and what are the implications for the small fry in this story â authors, agents, bookshops, and independent publishers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that this takeover will trigger a wave of further takeover activity. Rupert Murdochâs HarperCollins clearly has the will and capacity to swallow up one of its competitors, but News Corp is like an obnoxious rich boy with a history of bad behaviour that no girl wants to be seen in public with. I suspect that the only date it can get will be with Simon &amp;amp; Schuster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also geo-political complications: the huge French-based multinational Lagardere owns famous imprints in the UK and the US, such as Little, Brown, Hachette, and Hodder &amp;amp; Stoughton, while the large German-based house von Holtzbrinck owns notable publishing companies worldwide, such as Macmillan, Henry Holt, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux. It is hard to imagine either company agreeing to be bought out by the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess, then, is that the Big Six will become the Big Four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, the results are even more speculative. For authors, thereâs likely to be less choice as the larger houses focus even more on the pursuit of blockbusters, and stop bidding against each other internally. It may mean that advances will go up for highly commercial manuscripts, but theyâd be likely to do so while they decline for midlist books. If this is right, literary agents will see this as a mixed blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bookshops might welcome having fewer publishers to deal with, but I suspect theyâll have less bargaining power in their pursuit of marketing support. The large houses that remain may also be less worried about the further decline of physical bookshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent publishers will also view these developments with some anxiety. It will make it even harder for them to acquire good books at reasonable prices, and will probably accelerate the trend towards global publishing. It may also make their dependence on large houses for sales and/or distribution facilities more fraught. This is a much bigger and more important subject than it might seem, as it is the key to the independentsâ business model â and to the availability of their books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big commercial books will always find their market, but all those other books we all need are only made available to readers by people who care about what theyâre doing. That needs personal dedication â committed publishers, hand-selling booksellers, passionate reviewers and bloggers, and ultimately word-of-mouth recommendations. Anything that puts this ecology at risk puts our civilisation at risk, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/our-harsh-logic/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic: Israeli soldiers' testimonies from the Occupied Territories, 2000â2010&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first book compiled by Breaking the Silence, one of Israelâs most internationally lauded non-government organisations. Philosopher and author Raimond Gaita gave this speech on the occasion of the book&amp;rsquo;s Australian publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt; is a book of testimonies by Israeli soldiers who served on the West Bank and Gaza strip between 2000 and 2010. For obvious reason, its 374 pages make for depressing reading. How could it be otherwise? Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967 and withdrew from Gaza only in 2005, to invade it again in 2008.  Its external control over Gaza remains so complete that many international lawyers argue that it is still in occupation of it. With a similar history, soldiers of an occupying army of any nation in the world would have similar stories to tell. No one should be surprised by the contents of &lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons of the Holocaust, we have repeatedly and justifiably been told, is that ordinary people can do morally terrible things â things so terrible, indeed, that they can add up to the greatest evil in our recorded history. Why then should anyone be surprised that ordinary young Israelis should commit deeds such as are described in this book? They range from deeds that are obviously criminal according to international law â wrongful killings of various kinds and the use of human shields, for example â to deeds that are not criminal according to law, but which express disdain for the humanity of the Palestinians of the kind to be expected from an occupying army of long standing, often compounded by racist hostility to the Palestinians as Arabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt; is therefore a depressing book, but it is also an inspiring one. It testifies to dehumanisation and worse, but it testifies also to courage: firstly to the courage of the soldiers who faced what they had done and witnessed, who in many cases faced truthfully their own dehumanisation and wrong doing; and secondly to the courage of members of Breaking the Silence. Anyone who knows Israel will understand that it requires courage to publish such a book into a public made up of citizen soldiers that venerates its defence forces, a public in which most families must know in their hearts that many of their friends and family members could tell the same stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is also admirable because its editors wisely avoided political comment except insofar as it follows unavoidably from what the soldiers said they did and witnessed. That ensures the book&amp;rsquo;s integrity as a book of testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic &lt;/em&gt;is divided into four sections. The last section â Law Enforcement: A Dual Regime &amp;ndash; has probably the most direct political implications because it makes undeniable to anyone who accepts that the testimonies are for the most part truthful, that the IDF has long been complicit in the settlement programme pursued by successive Israeli governments. Because there are now over 350,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank, many people on the left and the right believe the two-state solution is unrealistic. No Israeli government, they think, would be prepared to dismantle as many settlements as would be necessary for a two-state solution that is acceptable to the Palestinians as even a minimal fulfilment of their national aspirations. But because this conclusion concerning IDF complicity is inescapable if the testimony is truthful, it is not the conclusion drawn in the pursuit of a controversial political agenda. It is quite absurd to say, as some of its critics have, that &lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt; is a book of propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction between conclusions that follow inevitably from the testimonies in this book and those, which though they may be reasonable, do not and are therefore controversial, is very important.  If &lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt; expressed conclusions of the latter kind â conclusions that are reasonable but which, because they do not strictly follow from the testimony, can also be reasonably contested â it would have undermined its integrity as a book of witness because it would have undermined trust in it. It would have given people legitimate reason to wonder whether the testimonies had been selected, perhaps even manipulated, to serve a political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I lack imagination, but I cannot think of any political opinion about the options in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that need deny, if they are brutally honest, the testimonies in this book. Even radical settlers could accept them and then say that the deeds they record are the price they are prepared to pay for the success of their struggle for a Greater Israel (assuming they object to those deeds). The testimonies are consistent with a two-state solution and with the left- and right-wing varieties of a one-state solution.  They are consistent with Zionism, post-Zionism, and anti-Zionism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, I believe, is true of the book considered only as a book of testimonies. The editorial position, however, appears to require that Jews retain an Israeli identity in any solution to the conflict, even if there is no Jewish state. That, indeed, is suggested in the bookâs title &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt;, rather than the impersonal, âThe Harsh Logic of the IDFâ or some variation on that.  The explicit use of the first person plural indicates identification â regretful, sorrowful, ashamed identification, but identification nonetheless. It therefore expresses the only form of patriotism that is worth anything â truthful patriotism that desires to live a national life without the shame that would be the only honest and lucid response if the nationâs leaders and soldiers committed crimes that would justifiably bring them before an international criminal court. From the perspective of such patriotism â patriotism distinguished from the counterfeit of it that we call jingoism â even severe criticism of one&amp;rsquo;s country can be amongst the highest form of loyalty to it and an expression of the most serious concern for its welfare. In publishing &lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt;, Breaking the Silence expresses just such concern for the country to which its members belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who should read this book? Everyone who is seriously concerned about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict â Israelis, Palestinians, and most diaspora Jews, obviously.  But also everyone who is not a pacifist. As I said at the beginning, no one should be surprised by the testimonies in this book, which, of course, is one reason why no one has any reason to doubt that they are on the whole truthful. If we are not pacifists, then we rely on our armed forces to protect what we cherish most deeply in our national lives. Yet hardly ever do we think seriously about how we might reduce the vulnerability of our soldiers to the dehumanising consequences of protracted war and the likelihood that they will do morally terrible things. If there is to be even a slight chance of this, we all need to acknowledge truths of the kind recounted in &lt;em&gt;Our Harsh Logic&lt;/em&gt;, not only in our heads, but also deeply in our bones.'&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>[*Our Harsh Logic: Israeli soldiers' testimonies from the Occupied Territories, 2000â2010*](http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/our-harsh-logic/) is the first book compiled by Breaking the Silence, one of Israelâs most internationally lauded non-government organisations. Philosopher and author Raimond Gaita gave this speech on the occasion of the book's Australian publication.

'*Our Harsh Logic* is a book of testimonies by Israeli soldiers who served on the West Bank and Gaza strip between 2000 and 2010. For obvious reason, its 374 pages make for depressing reading. How could it be otherwise? Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967 and withdrew from Gaza only in 2005, to invade it again in 2008.  Its external control over Gaza remains so complete that many international lawyers argue that it is still in occupation of it.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce we&amp;rsquo;re setting up a UK office in the new year. Our sales and distribution will be handled by the Faber Factory Plus organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe publisher Henry Rosenbloom said, âIâve been mulling over this move for a couple of years, as I was determined to find the best and most appropriate solution for our needs. Iâm delighted that weâll be one of Faber Factory Plusâs clients, and that weâll be able to join the ranks of the UKâs notable independent houses that Iâve long admired from afar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âThis is a big step for a small company to take, but the reasons for it are compelling, on both the buying and selling sides. It will give us the capacity to acquire UK and Commonwealth rights in some overseas-originated titles that would otherwise be denied us; and it also means that many more of our books, which come from many sources, will be available in much of the English-reading world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âStarting next June, weâll be publishing 20â30 books a year in the UK, drawn from our local and international authors. Among our first titles will be &lt;em&gt;JM Coetzee: a life in writing&lt;/em&gt;, by JC Kannemeyer, the first-ever biography of the Nobel and Pulitzer Prizeâwinning author; &lt;em&gt;Futurevision&lt;/em&gt;: scenarios for the world in 2040, by London-based Richard Watson and his Australian co-author Oliver Freeman; and Cate Kennedyâs latest collection of short stories, &lt;em&gt;Like a House on Fire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âIâm also delighted to announce that weâve appointed Rina Gill as our publicity director. Rina, who won the UK Publicist of the Year Award in 2010, and the award for the best hardback non-fiction campaign in 2008, is a former publicity director for Corvus, deputy publicity director for Cornerstone, and publicity director for Century.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Atkinson, the sales and marketing director and director of independent publishing services at Faber and Faber Ltd, said, âHenry embodies all that is great about independent publishing. Scribe Publications have consistently represented the highest of standards throughout their long and distinguished history. We are immensely proud to be partners and to be able to bring Scribe to readers in the UK.â&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Something very important happened during the 2012 US presidential election-campaigns â and Iâm not referring to the campaigns themselves, or to the behaviour of the candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; blogger called Nate Silver predicted all of the key results with unerring accuracy. He got each of the 50 states right. This meant that he got the key âbattlegroundâ states right, including those with very close margins, such as Florida. He got the popular vote right (he predicted that Obama would get 50.8 per cent against Romneyâs 48.3 per cent â the actual margin was 51.1 per cent to 47.2 per cent); and he got the electoral-college vote right (he predicted that Obama would get 313 electoral votes against Romneyâs 225 â the actual margin was 332 to 206).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but you get the picture. What makes this all the more impressive is that the USâs voluntary voting system makes it very difficult to make accurate forecasts in tight races, because itâs hard to know what the turnout will be like, or whether it will differ significantly either demographically or ethnically from previous turnouts â and opinion polls have to not only capture voting intentions accurately, but to build in assumptions about both these key factors. He was also making forecasts that differed significantly from those provided by large, well-endowed national polling companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a personal level, Silver kept updating and holding to his predictions (which he calls âprojectionsâ) while he was under ferocious criticism from conservative pundits as being a liberal who was running a self-serving Democratic Party line. The same commentators criticised all opinion polls they didnât agree with on similar grounds. (As it turns out, theyâd swallowed their own Kool Aid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silverâs blog, &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt; (which is the total number of electoral-college votes up for grabs) has been hosted by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; for a couple of years. So far as I know, Silver hasnât revealed the full details of the model he uses, but itâs apparent that itâs based on a judicious interpretation of opinion polls. Because of the USâs electoral-college system (which we in Australia would think of as an indirect first-past-the-post system), Silver is less influenced by national opinion polls than the media and the usual suspects are. Instead, he has compiled a history of opinion-polling results in each state, a set of local characteristics that he calls âState fundamentalsâ, and a discount factor that he applies to the polling results to produce what he calls an âadjusted polling averageâ. This ends up being expressed as a projected vote-share, and a probabalistic figure for the outcome, which he summarises as the candidatesâ âchance of winningâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in one of the key battleground states, Virginia, where the opinion polls had Obama leading by only just over 1 per cent, Silver came up with a projected vote for Obama of 50.7 per cent to 48.7 per cent, and gave him a 79 per cent chance of winning the state. Obama won by 50.8 per cent to 47.8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver seems to apply discounts to national polls as well, and is clearly much more interested in updated polling averages than in the latest poll/s at any given time. Because of Americaâs size and relatively dense population, heâs helped by the vast number of local polls that are carried out during election campaigns. In other words, he has a lot of information â both current and historic â at his disposal. But, clearly, he applies a great deal of statistical expertise to these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers of Silverâs bestselling book, &lt;em&gt;The Signal and the Noise&lt;/em&gt;, will know that he comes from a background of statistical analysis of baseball, and of professional poker-playing. He understands the basis for establishing probabilities in a wide range of fields (including weather forecasting), and isnât frightened of following the evidence wherever it takes him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from anything else, he could see that Obama was ahead where it mattered â in the battleground states â and that he wasnât relinquishing that lead as the election neared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Nate Silverâs achievements have local significance. Before and during the election campaign, he kept showing Obama as having a very high chance of winning; in fact, by election eve, he nominated that chance as being 90.9 per cent; conversely, he said that Romney had a 9.1 per cent chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, at a time when national opinion polls showed only a small gap in Obamaâs favour. In Australia, US-based print and TV correspondents all opined that the election was â you guessed it â âtoo close to callâ. This was particularly noticeable on the ABCâs radio and TV news programs, as well as on its flagship TV current-affairs program, &lt;em&gt;7.30&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to put too fine a point on it, these journalists didnât know what they were talking about. The election was only too close to call if you werenât looking in the right places. They were doing what was easy, and what they thought was safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their failure is the take-home message from Nate Silverâs achievements. General correspondents have no right to editorialise about the implications of opinion polls if they donât have a grasp of the nuts and bolts behind the polls â or at least donât talk to people who do. In Australia, &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;âs Dennis Shanahan has been shown up by electoral-specialist bloggers several times for his inadequate rendering of opinion polls conducted by Newspoll, the company owned by his employers. And our major newspapers, which commission the main polls, have a self-serving habit of splashing the latest poll results as though they were definitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism is under enough external challenges without scoring own goals. Australiaâs electoral system is very different from Americaâs (voting is compulsory for a start, so thereâs much less need to enrol voters or to get them to vote), but in 2013, an election year, there will be immense pressure on political journalists to behave professionally. Some of them could do worse than start the year by researching the track record of Australiaâs opinion-polling organisations, and try to come up with evidence-based probabilities of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Rosenbloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A *New York Times* blogger called Nate Silver predicted all of the key results with unerring accuracy. He got each of the 50 states right. This meant that he got the key âbattlegroundâ states right, including those with very close margins, such as Florida. He got the popular vote right (he predicted that Obama would get 50.8 per cent against Romneyâs 48.3 per cent â the actual margin was 51.1 per cent to 47.2 per cent); and he got the electoral-college vote right (he predicted that Obama would get 313 electoral votes against Romneyâs 225 â the actual margin was 332 to 206).

I could go on, but you get the picture. What makes this all the more impressive is that the USâs voluntary voting system makes it very difficult to make accurate forecasts in tight races, because itâs hard to know what the turnout will be like, or whether it will differ significantly either demographically or ethnically from previous turnouts â and opinion polls have to not only capture voting intentions accurately, but to build in assumptions about both these key factors. He was also making forecasts that differed significantly from those provided by large, well-endowed national polling companies.

At a personal level, Silver kept updating and holding to his predictions (which he calls âprojectionsâ) while he was under ferocious criticism from conservative pundits as being a liberal who was running a self-serving Democratic Party line. The same commentators criticised all opinion polls they didnât agree with on similar grounds. (As it turns out, theyâd swallowed their own Kool Aid.)

Silverâs blog, *FiveThirtyEight* (which is the total number of electoral-college votes up for grabs) has been hosted by the *Times* for a couple of years. So far as I know, Silver hasnât revealed the full details of the model he uses, but itâs apparent that itâs based on a judicious interpretation of opinion polls. Because of the USâs electoral-college system (which we in Australia would think of as an indirect first-past-the-post system), Silver is less influenced by national opinion polls than the media and the usual suspects are. Instead, he has compiled a history of opinion-polling results in each state, a set of local characteristics that he calls âState fundamentalsâ, and a discount factor that he applies to the polling results to produce what he calls an âadjusted polling averageâ. This ends up being expressed as a projected vote-share, and a probabalistic figure for the outcome, which he summarises as the candidatesâ âchance of winningâ.

For example, in one of the key battleground states, Virginia, where the opinion polls had Obama leading by only just over 1 per cent, Silver came up with a projected vote for Obama of 50.7 per cent to 48.7 per cent, and gave him a 79 per cent chance of winning the state. Obama won by 50.8 per cent to 47.8 per cent.

Silver seems to apply discounts to national polls as well, and is clearly much more interested in updated polling averages than in the latest poll/s at any given time. Because of Americaâs size and relatively dense population, heâs helped by the vast number of local polls that are carried out during election campaigns. In other words, he has a lot of information â both current and historic â at his disposal. But, clearly, he applies a great deal of statistical expertise to these numbers.

Readers of Silverâs bestselling book, *The Signal and the Noise*, will know that he comes from a background of statistical analysis of baseball, and of professional poker-playing. He understands the basis for establishing probabilities in a wide range of fields (including weather forecasting), and isnât frightened of following the evidence wherever it takes him.

Apart from anything else, he could see that Obama was ahead where it mattered â in the battleground states â and that he wasnât relinquishing that lead as the election neared.

This is where Nate Silverâs achievements have local significance. Before and during the election campaign, he kept showing Obama as having a very high chance of winning; in fact, by election eve, he nominated that chance as being 90.9 per cent; conversely, he said that Romney had a 9.1 per cent chance.

This, at a time when national opinion polls showed only a small gap in Obamaâs favour. In Australia, US-based print and TV correspondents all opined that the election was â you guessed it â âtoo close to callâ. This was particularly noticeable on the ABCâs radio and TV news programs, as well as on its flagship TV current-affairs program, *7.30*.

Not to put too fine a point on it, these journalists didnât know what they were talking about. The election was only too close to call if you werenât looking in the right places. They were doing what was easy, and what they thought was safe.

Their failure is the take-home message from Nate Silverâs achievements. General correspondents have no right to editorialise about the implications of opinion polls if they donât have a grasp of the nuts and bolts behind the polls â or at least donât talk to people who do. In Australia, *The Australian*âs Dennis Shanahan has been shown up by electoral-specialist bloggers several times for his inadequate rendering of opinion polls conducted by Newspoll, the company owned by his employers. And our major newspapers, which commission the main polls, have a self-serving habit of splashing the latest poll results as though they were definitive.

Journalism is under enough external challenges without scoring own goals. Australiaâs electoral system is very different from Americaâs (voting is compulsory for a start, so thereâs much less need to enrol voters or to get them to vote), but in 2013, an election year, there will be immense pressure on political journalists to behave professionally. Some of them could do worse than start the year by researching the track record of Australiaâs opinion-polling organisations, and try to come up with evidence-based probabilities of their own.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;StÃ©phane Hessel, the author of &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/indignez-vous/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indignez-Vous!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has passed away at the age of 95. Born in Germany in 1917, Hessel moved to France with his Jewish writer father and mother in 1924. He fought in the French army in 1940 and escaped from a POW camp to join de Gaulleâs Free French in London. On his clandestine return to organise the Resistance in France, he was captured, tortured, and sent to the Buchenwald and Dora concentration camps. He escaped death to work after the war on drafting the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Publication of Hessel&amp;rsquo;s recent essay &lt;em&gt;Indignez-Vous!&lt;/em&gt;, which sold more than 4.5 million copies in 35 countries, is credited with helping to inspire the Occupy Wall Street movement, and coincided with the Arab Spring revolutions. Protests in Spain against corruption and bipartisan politics drew their name, Indignaos, from the Spanish title of Hessel&amp;rsquo;s essay. A full obituary can be read &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/27/writer-activist-stephane-hessel-dies-aged-95"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;âIâm the binge-drinking health reporter. During the week, I write about Australiaâs booze-soaked culture. At the weekends, I write myself off.â&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booze had dominated Jill Starkâs social life ever since she had her first sip of beer, at 13. She thought nothing could curb her love of big nights. And then came the hangover that changed everything. In the shadow of her 35th year, Jill made a decision: she would give up alcohol. But what would it mean to stop drinking in a world awash with booze?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lively memoir charts Jillâs tumultuous year on the wagon, as she copes with the stress of the newsroom sober, tackles the dating scene on soda water, learns to watch the footy minus beer, and deals with censure from friends and colleagues, who tell her that a year without booze is âa year with no matesâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In re-examining her habits, Jill also explores Australiaâs love affair with alcohol, meeting alcopop-swigging teens who drink to fit in, beer-swilling blokes in a sporting culture backed by booze, and marketing bigwigs blamed for turning binge drinking into a way of life. And she tracks the history of this national obsession: from the idea that Australiaâs new colonies were drowning in drink to the Anzac ethos that a beer builds mateship, and from the six oâclock swill that encouraged bingeing to the tangled weave of advertising, social pressure, and tradition that confronts drinkers today.
&lt;strong&gt;
Will Jill make it through the year without booze? And if she does, will she go back to her old habits, or has she called last drinks? This is a funny, moving, and insightful exploration of why we drink, how we got here, and what happens when we turn off the tap.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cat &amp;amp; Fiddle&lt;/em&gt; centres on two families whose lives become entwined at the country estate of Bourne Abbey. While Dr Choudhury is busy advising Henry Bourne on the restoration of the abbey to its former glory, his wifeâs main concern is marrying off their three children, whose chances of good matches are dwindling by the day. Thankfully, the royal family always seems to have a solution to her problems: how to find a wife for a reluctant son; how to manage a difficult father-in-law; and, of course, how not to deal with an inter-faith relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then thereâs the Bourne family. Henryâs wife, Thea, is feeling lost, now that sheâs got the lifestyle sheâs always longed for. His elder brother, Richard, a successful London barrister, finds himself increasingly drawn to the family home â the inheritance that heâs given up. Meanwhile, Henry just wants to keep the peace, but thatâs proving to be tricky â¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally, thereâs Bourne Abbey itself: the repository of an ancient mystery that links the histories and cultures of the Bournes and the Choudhurys in a way that no one could have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The media is already abuzz with news of both the forthcoming new edition of the American Psychiatric Associationâs &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt;, and Gary Greenbergâs &lt;em&gt;The Book of Woe&lt;/em&gt;, a brilliant investigation of everything thatâs wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considered the bible of modern psychiatry, the DSM is used to classify and diagnose mental illnesses. But itâs now coming under fire from professional bodies who say that they will not be supporting its use, from the National Institute of Mental Health, who say &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-nimh-withdraws-support-dsm-5"&gt;Patients with mental disorders deserve better&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; to the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/may/12/psychiatrists-under-fire-mental-health"&gt;British Psychological Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Book of Woe&lt;/em&gt;, practicing psychotherapist Gary Greenberg takes this critique further, arguing that the DSM is dangerously unscientific, all too vulnerable to social and historic forces, and increasingly defined by market values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Woe&lt;/em&gt; is already receiving &lt;a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113097/gary-greenberg-book-woe-reviewed-martha-stout"&gt;rave reviews&lt;/a&gt; overseas, and the Australian edition is now available to pre-order or buy â for more information see &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/promotions/the-book-of-woe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>The media is already abuzz with news of both the forthcoming new edition of the American Psychiatric Associationâs *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, and Gary Greenbergâs *The Book of Woe*, a brilliant investigation of everything thatâs wrong with it. 

Considered the bible of modern psychiatry, the DSM is used to classify and diagnose mental illnesses. But itâs now coming under fire from professional bodies who say that they will not be supporting its use, from the National Institute of Mental Health, who say '[Patients with mental disorders deserve better](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-nimh-withdraws-support-dsm-5)' to the [British Psychological Society](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/may/12/psychiatrists-under-fire-mental-health). 

In *The Book of Woe*, practicing psychotherapist Gary Greenberg takes this critique further, arguing that the DSM is dangerously unscientific, all too vulnerable to social and historic forces, and increasingly defined by market values.

*The Book of Woe* is already receiving [rave reviews](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113097/gary-greenberg-book-woe-reviewed-martha-stout) overseas, and the Australian edition is now available to pre-order or buy â for more information see [here](http://scribepublications.com.au/promotions/the-book-of-woe/). </content>

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The launch of &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.co.uk/"&gt;Scribeâs UK website&lt;/a&gt; marks an important development in the companyâs history. It signals Scribeâs expansion overseas, at a time when the book industry is under great pressure in much of the world. As such, it is a mark of confidence in the future of the book itself, as well as in our staffâs editorial judgements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflected on the site is an array of books to be published in the UK for the first time, along with a backlist of titles that have never been made available in this country before. All of the books represent what I might call Scribeâs sensibility â a dedication to books that matter, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the pursuit of excellence in the development and presentation of our list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that books are vital to the health of any civilisation, and that good books donât appear by accident â their authors have to be nurtured, and their works have to be attended to fastidiously, and then championed. Ultimately, good books depend on good publishers, both using a range of high-level skills, in the service of the wider society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to demonstrate, with this list and this website, that we have joined that cohort in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who follow cricket will have noticed that weâre obviously a nation that puts a lot of store on careful, planned, and well-thought-out transfers of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if, by any chance, you follow Australian politics, youâll have noticed the same thing with the defenestration of Julia Gillard as our prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do I start in accounting for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tony Abbott, the leader of the opposition, who waged a vicious, relentless, no-holds-barred, unprincipled campaign against the legitimacy of a minority government, and the authority of the prime minister in that government, despite having sought to be anointed as the head of a minority government himself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the media in general, and Rupert Murdochâs minions in particular, who waged a similar campaign, laying siege to Prime Minister Gillard and the Labor government from day one â finding fault with every policy, exaggerating every shortcoming, boosting Kevin Rudd and his treacherous supporters at every opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Kevin Rudd, who never accepted his colleaguesâ rejection of him, who never stopped sabotaging and conspiring against Gillardâs leadership, who was prepared to see the government brought down rather than abandon his insatiable ambitions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Julia Gillard, who was the victim of a vicious, outrageous, rolling misogynistic campaign by shock-jocks and many men around the country, who had to negotiate a hung parliament for three years, who had to battle against an opposition that tried to create a continuous sense of crisis and the leader sheâd supplanted who did everything he could to create one â and yet managed to enact a series of major reforms in the classic Labor tradition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the country itself, which despaired of the way that national politics had descended into personal vituperation and empty sloganeering â instigated and pursued by the opposition â but which refused to give Gillard the credit she deserved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs true, of course, that none of the above could have had the effect it did if Gillard had not demonstrated serious flaws of her own. Her judgement was sometimes wrong, and she often had difficulty in communicating the essence of her policies crisply and well. Although she was a superb negotiator, she was not a deep thinker, and was sometimes superficial and wrong-headed in her political actions. But if former Australian prime ministers were to be judged by those standards, they wouldnât last long in anyoneâs estimation. Gough Whitlam had spectacularly bad judgement (the highlight of which was his personal appointment as governor-general of a dreadful individual and class traitor who went on to dismiss him and his government). Paul Keating could never resist an opportunity to put his foot in his mouth. And the most recent Liberal prime minister, John Howard, made a series of tremendous mistakes, culminating in his attack on workplace security that ultimately cost him power and his own seat. Howard was wrong about key issues (such as the invasion of Iraq), and at one stage abandoned all political principles to save his own neck. His reputation does not appear to have suffered, despite all these egregious faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the opinion polls despatched Julia Gillard and seemed to validate the various campaigns against her leadership. Labor was facing a wipe-out at the general election, and it was too much to expect the parliamentary party to walk willingly into this nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the left-of-centre Melbourne &lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt; editorialised for Gillard to step aside last Saturday, the jig was clearly up. That didnât stop it, of course, from behaving mendaciously when it got what it wanted: it greeted Ruddâs re-ascendancy with the front-page headline, âRuddâs Revengeâ. How thatâs for having your cake and eating it, too? With bad-faith behaviour like this, the &lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt; deserves to disappear beneath the waters of Port Phillip Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking purely for myself, I would have far preferred Labor to have campaigned with Julia Gillard at its head, and to lose honourably. That way, the government would have maintained its integrity, the party would have demonstrated its loyalty, and Kevin Rudd would have been despatched forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say this, believing the party under Kevin Ruddâs leadership will lose far fewer seats at the election than it would have. Tony Abbott is a deeply unpopular leader of the opposition (deservedly so, in my opinion), and if Ruddâs re-emergence leads to Labor being competitive in opinion polls, it may even force the Liberals to consider their own form of emergency surgery. Come on down, Malcolm Turnbull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I donât believe that bad behaviour should be rewarded, and I donât believe that Rudd redux would behave any better than he did the first time around. If Kevin Rudd were to win (which I still think is highly unlikely), he would become Australiaâs Tony Blair, appealing to the public above his party, and traducing Labor values in the process. And we all know how that ended.&lt;/p&gt;

With Julia Gillard, who was the victim of a vicious, outrageous, rolling misogynistic campaign by shock-jocks and many men around the country, who had to negotiate a hung parliament for three years, who had to battle against an opposition that tried to create a continuous sense of crisis and the leader sheâd supplanted who did everything he could to create one â and yet managed to enact a series of major reforms in the classic Labor tradition?

With the country itself, which despaired of the way that national politics had descended into personal vituperation and empty sloganeering â instigated and pursued by the opposition â but which refused to give Gillard the credit she deserved?

Itâs true, of course, that none of the above could have had the effect it did if Gillard had not demonstrated serious flaws of her own. Her judgement was sometimes wrong, and she often had difficulty in communicating the essence of her policies crisply and well. Although she was a superb negotiator, she was not a deep thinker, and was sometimes superficial and wrong-headed in her political actions. But if former Australian prime ministers were to be judged by those standards, they wouldnât last long in anyoneâs estimation. Gough Whitlam had spectacularly bad judgement (the highlight of which was his personal appointment as governor-general of a dreadful individual and class traitor who went on to dismiss him and his government). Paul Keating could never resist an opportunity to put his foot in his mouth. And the most recent Liberal prime minister, John Howard, made a series of tremendous mistakes, culminating in his attack on workplace security that ultimately cost him power and his own seat. Howard was wrong about key issues (such as the invasion of Iraq), and at one stage abandoned all political principles to save his own neck. His reputation does not appear to have suffered, despite all these egregious faults.

In the end, the opinion polls despatched Julia Gillard and seemed to validate the various campaigns against her leadership. Labor was facing a wipe-out at the general election, and it was too much to expect the parliamentary party to walk willingly into this nightmare.

When the left-of-centre Melbourne *Age* editorialised for Gillard to step aside last Saturday, the jig was clearly up. That didnât stop it, of course, from behaving mendaciously when it got what it wanted: it greeted Ruddâs re-ascendancy with the front-page headline, âRuddâs Revengeâ. How thatâs for having your cake and eating it, too? With bad-faith behaviour like this, the *Age* deserves to disappear beneath the waters of Port Phillip Bay.

Speaking purely for myself, I would have far preferred Labor to have campaigned with Julia Gillard at its head, and to lose honourably. That way, the government would have maintained its integrity, the party would have demonstrated its loyalty, and Kevin Rudd would have been despatched forever.

I say this, believing the party under Kevin Ruddâs leadership will lose far fewer seats at the election than it would have. Tony Abbott is a deeply unpopular leader of the opposition (deservedly so, in my opinion), and if Ruddâs re-emergence leads to Labor being competitive in opinion polls, it may even force the Liberals to consider their own form of emergency surgery. Come on down, Malcolm Turnbull.

Ultimately, I donât believe that bad behaviour should be rewarded, and I donât believe that Rudd redux would behave any better than he did the first time around. If Kevin Rudd were to win (which I still think is highly unlikely), he would become Australiaâs Tony Blair, appealing to the public above his party, and traducing Labor values in the process. And we all know how that ended.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;In these thirteen short stories, Georgia Blain examines human nature in all its richness: our motivations, our desires and our shortcomings. The men in these tales frequently linger at the edges â their longings and failures exerting a subterranean pull on the women in their lives. In âThe Secret Lives of Menâ, a woman revisits her hometown and learns a long-held secret about her first boyfriend. In âThe Bad Dog Parkâ, a manâs devotion to his dog ultimately forces him to confront his true hopes and fears. And in âThe Other Side of the Riverâ, we watch as a woman makes a snap decision about her lifeâs future direction, with devastating consequences for her family. Written in Blainâs trademark unadorned yet powerful prose, these stories resonate long after they are finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Lives of Men&lt;/em&gt; is an exceptional collection by one of Australiaâs leading writers.&lt;/p&gt;

The judges said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kennedy enters into the domestic moment through a small door and finds a vista to the inner self. The stories are built on tenderness, treachery and loss and are pulled along by a compulsive longing. However dark the territory, Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s take on life is marked by humour. Her style is strong and expansive and lifts beyond its realist roots to reveal a master&amp;rsquo;s love of language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by country life and eager for adventure and excitement, seventeen-year-old Tom Button moves to the city to study. Once there, and living in a run-down apartment block called Cairo, he is befriended by the eccentric musician Max Cheever, his beautiful wife Sally, and their close-knit circle of painters and poets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tom falls under the sway of his charismatic older friends, he enters a bohemian world of parties and gallery openings. Soon, however, he is caught up in more sinister events involving deception and betrayal, not to mention one of the greatest unsolved art heists of the twentieth century: the infamous theft of Picassoâs &lt;em&gt;Weeping Woman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set among the demimonde â where nothing and nobody is as they seem â &lt;em&gt;Cairo&lt;/em&gt; is a novel about growing up, the perils of first love, and finding oneâs true place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that Scott Johnsonâs riveting memoir about growing up as the son of a CIA spy, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/the-wolf-and-the-watchman/"&gt;The Wolf and the Watchman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, has been longlisted in the non-fiction category of the USâs &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2013.html"&gt;National Book Awards&lt;/a&gt;. We are especially delighted because its route there has been a rather unusual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquired by Scribeâs publisher, Henry Rosenbloom, and edited by nonfiction editor Julia Carlomagno with input from freelance editor Nicola Redhouse, &lt;em&gt;The Wolf and the Watchman&lt;/em&gt; was first published in Australia in July 2012. Scribe acquired UK rights, and subsequently US rights, when the book failed to find a publisher in these territories, and we published it via Scribe UK just this month. Weâd previously sold US rights to W W Norton, who published their edition in May 2013. So a notable book by an American author about an American subject made its way to the US via Australia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon editor Chris Schluep had this to say: &amp;lsquo;Some books just sneak up on you and you&amp;rsquo;re never the same after &amp;hellip; This book is so personal, moving that I devoured it. Although the subject matter is difficult, you grow with the book as you read.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishers Weekly, who called the book &amp;lsquo;incredibly moving&amp;rsquo;, also named it as one of their &lt;a href="http://best-books.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2013/nonfiction#book/book-13"&gt;Best Books of 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>Some well-deserved recognition for David Finkel's *[Thank You for Your Service](http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/thank-you-for-your-service/)* â it's just been named as one of Amazon's Best Books of 2013, topping the nonfiction category. 

Amazon editor Chris Schluep had this to say: 'Some books just sneak up on you and you're never the same after ... This book is so personal, moving that I devoured it. Although the subject matter is difficult, you grow with the book as you read.'

Publishers Weekly, who called the book 'incredibly moving', also named it as one of their [Best Books of 2013](http://best-books.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2013/nonfiction#book/book-13).

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Weâre delighted to announce weâve made our first editorial appointment for our UK office, appointing former Granta Books publisher Philip Gwyn Jones to the part-time role of editor-at-large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe publisher Henry Rosenbloom says: âIâve been a huge admirer of his for several years, and we seem to have uncannily similar tastes and values. I had the idea for this job some time ago, without knowing whether Philip would be willing or able to take it on. As it happens, it seems like the right idea at the right time for both of us.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gwyn Jones will focus on acquiring rights to fiction and nonfiction titles by British and Irish writers, and will be involved in the structural editing of the acquired manuscripts and oversee their publication, as well as taking on a âgeneral ambassadorial roleâ for Scribe UK. Gwyn Jones says he will âconcentrate on just a handful of acquisitions each year â¦ focusing exclusively on the bold and original in literary fiction, and the urgent and persuasive in idea-led nonfiction â on books from these islands that might contend for prizes, in shortâ.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce that weâve signed Oliver Molâs first book, to be published in early 2015. &lt;em&gt;Lion Attack!&lt;/em&gt; is a high-voltage, energetic work of creative nonfiction that explores what it means to be an Australian today. Part love story, part tragi-comedy, and part social critique, it is a coming-of-age story with a contemporary beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver Mol, a Sydney-based writer, was one of the inaugural winners of the Scribe Nonfiction Prize for Young Writers, for his piece entitled â34 Memories of Growing Up in Texasâ. His work has appeared in journals and magazines, including in &lt;em&gt;Going Down Swinging&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Lifted Brow&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Voiceworks&lt;/em&gt;. In 2013, Oliver was the recipient of a Wheeler Centre Hot Desk Fellowship, during which he completed the first draft of his book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that Oliver is a talented new voice, and we look forward to bringing you his work in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;In 1949, the arrival of an Italian family sets tongues wagging in the village of Leyton, an English farming community still recovering from the war. For seventeen-year-old Connie, however, the newcomers provide a tantalising glimpse of the wider world â a world beyond the gossip and petty concerns traded over the counter of Cleatâs Corner Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under their fatherâs stern eye, the Onorati brothers adapt to their new life in remarkably different ways. While the charismatic Vittorio is determined to reinvent himself and embrace all things English, the solitary Lucio is haunted by the secrets of his past â events that tether him to the war in the mountains of Lazio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both brothers begin to cast an unexpected influence over Leyton, Connie realises that, like them, she must grapple with her ambitions and dreams for the future. But what can any of them hope to find in the ruins of all theyâve lost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Italians at Cleatâs Corner Store&lt;/em&gt; is a heartwarming, vividly observed tale of small-town life, exploring love, prejudice, and identity in the wake of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We were deeply saddened by the news that the acclaimed author Peter Matthiessen has passed away at the age of eighty-six. Scribe will publish his final book, &lt;em&gt;In Paradise&lt;/em&gt;, in Australia and New Zealand on 30 May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Matthiessen&amp;rsquo;s own experience at a Zen meditation retreat at Auschwitz in the 1990s, &lt;em&gt;In Paradise&lt;/em&gt; is a profoundly moving novel that is the culmination of an extraordinary career. It raises provocative questions, such as how beauty and joy can emerge out of horror; what responsibility comes with bearing witness to tragedy; and what insights will be lost as the last survivors of, and witnesses to, the death camps pass away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthiessen is the only writer to have won the American National Book Award more than once â he won it in two nonfiction categories for &lt;em&gt;The Snow Leopard&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1978, and in fiction three decades later for &lt;em&gt;Shadow Country&lt;/em&gt;. A full obituary can be read &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/books/peter-matthiessen-author-and-naturalist-is-dead-at-86.html?ref=books"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publicist (full time, 12-month maternity cover)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe, an award-winning independent book publisher, is seeking a publicist to join our publicity department. Working across a list that encompasses 50â55 titles per year of serious non-fiction and quality fiction, this job will provide an opportunity to construct high-profile media campaigns from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible for the conception and creation of effective consumer-media campaigns for specific titles, the successful applicant will be working closely with authors, editors, and everyone involved in the publishing process. The job includes attending literary festivals and author events, both locally and interstate, when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate a love of books,
excellent written and verbal communication skills, high-level organisational skills, a high degree of initiative, and the ability to work in a small office with good humour. Trade-publishing publicity experience is preferable, but applicants with a communications degree who are working in other industries are also encouraged to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply, please send a covering letter and your CV to Cora Kipling, Publicity Manager, Scribe Publications Pty Ltd, 18â20 Edward Street, Brunswick 3056, or email applications to cora@scribepub.com.au Position description available on request. &lt;strong&gt;Applications close Thursday 17 April.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production and Publishing Assistant (full time)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe is an award-winning independent book publisher with offices in Melbourne and London. We publish over 50 non-fiction and fiction titles annually in Australia and about 40 in the United Kingdom. We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated Production and Publishing Assistant to join our Brunswick office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting to the Managing Editor and working across both the local and UK lists, the role will involve all aspects of the book production process, including the accurate and timely preparation of print files, proofing and approval of printer proofs, monitoring of costings and schedules, organising reprints, database maintenance, and basic layout and typesetting functions. Publishing assistance will include the researching and entering of literary awards, and maintaining the log of unsolicited submissions, in addition to a range of general administrative duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role requires proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite (particularly InDesign and Photoshop skills) and Microsoft Office. The successful applicant will also demonstrate excellent organisational and communication skills, a fastidious eye for detail, flexibility in working to tight deadlines and shifting priorities, and the ability to work in a small team. Experience in publishing is desirable, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply, please send a covering letter and CV to Tamsin Wagner, General Manager, Scribe Publications Pty Ltd, 18â20 Edward Street, Brunswick 3056, or email applications to tamsin@scribepub.com.au Position description available on request. &lt;strong&gt;Applications close Thursday 17 April.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It will be the first book to answer the question of what really happened in his final two years â his life with his children, his financial crises, and the weeks leading up to his shocking death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an unusual book for Scribe to publish, and what emerges from its pages is very different from what many people might expect. It paints a portrait of a loving father, struggling to live a normal life under extraordinary circumstances; it dismantles the tabloid myths, and gives Michael Jackson back his humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide English language publication will be on 3 June.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;I want to see more diverse voices in Australian historical novels to tell the stories that the ghosts want told&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâre delighted to announce that weâve acquired a debut novel from a talented Sydney writer, Anna Westbrook. &lt;em&gt;The Quiet Noise&lt;/em&gt; is eloquent and spare, based on the real-life murder of a young girl in inner Sydney in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna, who has a PhD in creative writing and teaches at New York Universityâs Sydney campus, says of the book, &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;The Quiet Noise&lt;/em&gt; came from a chance dalliance in a coffee shop with a pictorial history of Newtown and a story about a murder in a cemetery. The cemetery I knew intimately &amp;ndash; it was around the corner. The dark night in 1946 I knew nothing about, but could not shake. It took more than five years to listen to the noise and learn about the history of my community in those turbulent years after the Second World War and find the traces of that world left in this one. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to be publishing with Scribe because I want to see more diverse voices in Australian historical novels to tell the stories that the ghosts want told*.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quiet Noise&lt;/em&gt; will be published in 2015, but you can see Anna at the Emerging Writers' Festival next week. She&amp;rsquo;ll be appearing in two panels: &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/event-detail/industry-insiders-the-future-of-teaching-writing/"&gt;&amp;lsquo;Industry Insiders: The Future of Teaching Writing&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/the-writers-conference/"&gt;&amp;lsquo;Looking Back, Looking Forward&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about Oliver Mol. Oliver, a Sydney-based writer, was one of the winners of the inaugural Scribe Nonfiction Prize for Young Writers last year (and he is young! Just 25 when he won it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after his win, we signed his first book â a high-voltage work of creative nonfiction called &lt;em&gt;Lion Attack!&lt;/em&gt;  Part love story, part tragi-comedy, and part social critique, &lt;em&gt;Lion Attack!&lt;/em&gt; is a coming-of-age story that explores what it means to be Australian today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we asked Oliver what he was most looking forward to about being published, he answered in trademark Oliver style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to holding my book and being like: woah, i made something. i&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to probably just smiling like an idiot for a while. but then after the &amp;ldquo;woah&amp;rdquo; part, i&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going to the outback with a bunch of friends. we&amp;rsquo;re gonna rent a car and visit heaps of RSLs and country pubs and do microfiction/nonfiction/poetry readings in those places. the trip will be a part of my next book, along with other trips i have gone on. if i&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough, in a few years, i&amp;rsquo;ll be able to hold another book and smile like an idiot again.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver won&amp;rsquo;t be holding his book in his hands until 2015 (which means neither will you) but he&amp;rsquo;ll be at the &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/the-writers-conference/"&gt;Emerging Writers' Festival&lt;/a&gt; next week, talking about being funny. You should definitely go and see him: 12pm, Saturday 31 May in the Yarra Room.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>Today, we're going to talk about Oliver Mol. Oliver, a Sydney-based writer, was one of the winners of the inaugural Scribe Nonfiction Prize for Young Writers last year (and he is young! Just 25 when he won it). 

Not long after his win, we signed his first book â a high-voltage work of creative nonfiction called *Lion Attack!*  Part love story, part tragi-comedy, and part social critique, *Lion Attack!* is a coming-of-age story that explores what it means to be Australian today. 

When we asked Oliver what he was most looking forward to about being published, he answered in trademark Oliver style: 

'i'm looking forward to holding my book and being like: woah, i made something. i'm looking forward to probably just smiling like an idiot for a while. but then after the "woah" part, i'm looking forward to going to the outback with a bunch of friends. we're gonna rent a car and visit heaps of RSLs and country pubs and do microfiction/nonfiction/poetry readings in those places. the trip will be a part of my next book, along with other trips i have gone on. if i'm lucky enough, in a few years, i'll be able to hold another book and smile like an idiot again.'

Oliver won't be holding his book in his hands until 2015 (which means neither will you) but he'll be at the [Emerging Writers' Festival](http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/the-writers-conference/) next week, talking about being funny. You should definitely go and see him: 12pm, Saturday 31 May in the Yarra Room. </content>

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;I can only hope that the book properly measures the trespass, and the size of their grief&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first noticed Martin&amp;rsquo;s talent back when he was an opinion writer for &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;, and signed him on the strength of his outstanding nonfiction proposal for a book centered around the murder of a young girl in Perth, titled &lt;em&gt;A Murder Without Motive: the killing of Rebecca Ryle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin is now Chief Correspondent for The Saturday Paper, and has been producing consistently powerful and challenging work. All we can say is that if you&amp;rsquo;ve been impressed by his work there &amp;hellip; well, just wait until you read his book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked what he&amp;rsquo;s looking forward to about being published, Martinâs response was characteristically thoughtful, displaying the same qualities of self-awareness and compassion that make his writing so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;At risk of sounding like a mawkish twat, the publication of my first book will realise a modest dream of mine. But any excitement is tempered by the fact that the book&amp;rsquo;s centre is a murdered young woman and her grieving family. I can only hope that the book properly measures the trespass, and the size of their grief.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Murder Without Motive&lt;/em&gt; is slated for publication in 2015. You can see Martin at the Emerging Writers' Festival next week: pick up some writing tips at the &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/event-detail/signal-writing-intensive-for-under-25s/"&gt;Signal Writing Intensive for Under 25s&lt;/a&gt;, or watch him deal with the big questions at &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/event-detail/emerging-qa-2/"&gt;Emerging Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;The final emerging writer in our series is Rebecca Giggs. Weâd been admiring Rebecca&amp;rsquo;s work from afar for a while before we signed her for a lyrical, thoughtful work of narrative nonfiction about humans' relationship to whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca is currently a creative-writing lecturer at Macquarie University in Sydney, and was shortlisted for the &lt;em&gt;Australian Book Review&lt;/em&gt;âs Calibre Prize this year.  Her book will be published in 2015, but her work will also be appearing in this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Best Australian Science Writing&lt;/em&gt; for those of you who can&amp;rsquo;t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca&amp;rsquo;s ambitions for publication are not just for herself, but for the publishing and bookselling industries as well: âI have a reverie, and I donât think itâs immodest, of going back to the bookstore I used to work in (the best bookstore in Australia, Perthâs &lt;a href="http://www.planetvideo.com.au/library/books/"&gt;Planet Books&lt;/a&gt; and thumbing the spine of my book on the shelf. In the reverie I do this not just after the book is released, but later, much later. Perhaps Planet keep ordering it because of my connection to the place, which would be nice, but sometimes I indulge myself in imagining that the book continues to be enjoyed for a long time. I am surprised to see it there, and then all I do is pull it a little out from the shelf, look at the cover art, and slide it back. Of course, the daydream is dependent not only on people continuing to want to read my work, but on the continuation of a fine independent bookstore well into the future as well. I hope there are always enough voracious readers on Beaufort Street to keep that place alive.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch Rebecca  at &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/event-detail/the-early-words-about-the-animals/"&gt;The Early Words&lt;/a&gt; where she will be talking about the relationship between humans and animals, and â if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have grabbed a ticket, because itâs sold out! â at her &lt;a href="http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/event-detail/writing-night-school-creative-nonfiction-with-rebecca-giggs/"&gt;Writing Night School&lt;/a&gt; session on creative nonfiction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an edited transcript of Jonathan Holmes launching, in trademark erudite fashion, Denis Muller&amp;rsquo;s new book, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/journalism-ethics-for-the-digital-age/"&gt;Journalism Ethics for the Digital Age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warning. The following speech is classified as suitable for mature audiences. It contains coarse language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Coulson, erstwhile editor of &lt;em&gt;The News of the World&lt;/em&gt;, now serving some 18 months at Her Majestyâs pleasure, was born and brought up in Wickford, Essex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He began his career at the Basildon Evening Echo. Basildon is also in Essex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essex, of course, is a county that stretches from the eastern fringes of London along the north bank of the Thames to the dismal, marshy shores of the North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South-East Queensland is famous for its white shoes. Essex, for some reason, has always been famous for white socks, worn by its inhabitants with dark business suits. Put âEssex white socksâ into Google, and one of the entries that comes high in the responses is a blog called &lt;em&gt;Raedwald&lt;/em&gt;, whose author posted this as recently as 2011:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âIn the days when I used to commute from Suffolk to London, our table of regulars used to carry out a white-sock count as the train drew into the intermediate stations. Manningtree, the first Essex stop, would have a WSC of some 10%, Colchester 25% and Chelmsford 40%.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is all this leading, I hear you ask? Well, itâs leading to Kelvin McKenzie. Unlike Andy Coulson, who never quite made it to Rupert Murdochâs redtop daily, but like Coulsonâs boss, friend and lover, Rebekah Brooks, Mr MacKenzie was the editor of &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, until recently overtaken by Ms Brooks, he was probably the most notorious of that newspaperâs editors. He held the job for 13 years, from 1981 to 1994; it was his genius that put flesh on the bones of Rupert Murdochâs instinct: that there was money to be made by appealing to the Alf Garnett, the secret inner fascist, in the British working-class reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Kelvinâs most famous bon mots was uttered when some poor sap on &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; chose to include the word âethicsâ in a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âWotâs this?â MacKenzie is said to have roared. âEfficks? Efficks? Inât that the place east oâ London where they all wear white fuckin socks?â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he would have made of a book about journalism efficks which re-introduces us to Hobbes, and Locke, and Rousseau, Kant and Bentham and John Stuart Mill, I shudder to think. âNasty, brutish and short?â, I hear him cry. âThatâs not the life of man prior to the social contract. Thatâs description of the ideal &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; headline!â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do know what Kelvin thought of Lord Justice Levesonâs Inquiry into the Essex â Iâm sorry, that should read âethicsâ â of the press, because he gave his lordship the benefit of his wisdom in a notorious statement to the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began: âSo where is David Cameron today? Where is our great Prime Minister who ordered this ludicrous enquiry?â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacKenzie continued as he had begun, pouring scorn on the questions he had been requested to answer. No, he didnât check the sources of the stories in his paper, he said. âBasically my view was that if it sounded right, it probably was right and therefore we should lob it in,â he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of laws already, he said, to deal with wrongdoing at the &lt;em&gt;News of the World&lt;/em&gt;. The only relevant activity that wasnât already illegal, but should be made so, was arse-kissing of newspaper proprietors by politicians. âDo that and you will have my blessingâ he told Lord Justice Leveson, âand I suspect the blessing from Rupert Murdoch, too.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, do that in Australia and we would make a felon of every prime minister since Gough Whitlam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point is this: around the water-coolers of Fleet Street and Canary Wharf, ethics are not much discussed. British journalists, even more than Australian, are well aware of the constraints imposed by the law â especially the law of defamation. But the idea that a reporter should exercise his or her individual conscience in deciding how, or indeed whether, to put a story in the paper is entirely foreign to the way most papers are run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that cavalier attitude to ethics goes â or used to go â an equally insouciant attitude to readerâs complaints. Denis Muller records in the preface to his book that discovering, on becoming news editor of the &lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; in the 1980s, that there were people out there who considered that he and the newspaper were publicly accountable was, and I quote, âa searing experienceâ. Most complainants, he made clear, got short shrift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I became executive producer of &lt;em&gt;Four Corners&lt;/em&gt; in 1982 â about the same time as Denis got his job as news editor at the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;. I arrived straight from England to take over what we used to grandly call âAustraliaâs premier current affairs programâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a public broadcaster, we took complaints a mite more seriously than most commercial media did. But, when we received a rabid letter accusing &lt;em&gt;Four Corners&lt;/em&gt; of being staffed by reds, dedicated to the overthrow of a free Australia, Iâm afraid I assumed it was a joke. To someone who knew the country better, the North Queensland postmark might have warned me to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I blithely wrote back a jokey letter than began âDear Comradeâ. I acknowledged that of course he was right, though not many viewers had the acumen to penetrate our admittedly thin cover. We had been working for Moscow for years, I admitted, and fervently believed that the revolution was nigh. And I signed it, âJonathan Holmes, Ãommissar, the Four Corners Socialist Collectiveâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later â this was in the days of snail mail â my boss called me up to his office, and handed me a letter. It was addressed to the general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as it then was. It included photocopies of the original complaint, and of my reply. And it was copied to the chairman of the ABC, to each member of the commission, to the prime minister, the minister for communications, the governor-general, and the premier of every state in the Commonwealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boss explained to me that my little joke had not struck the ABCâs senior management as especially hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the worst excesses revealed by the phone-hacking scandal are not commonplace here in Australia. But, as its reaction to the Finkelstein Inquiry made clear, the Australian mainstream media is as loath as ever to acknowledge that it owes much to the Australian public in the way of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at &lt;em&gt;Media Watch&lt;/em&gt;, I was frequently invited to give talks and lectures on this topic. I was much given to quoting a passage written by a former editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;, and the founding director of the Centre for Advanced Journalism, Michael Gawenda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is my experience that editors and journalists are more interested in burying complaints from readers than addressing them â¦ and that most media organisations have wholly inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints by readers, viewers and listeners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would bet that most journalists on most newspapers â and indeed in most commercial television and radio organisations â could not outline their organisationâs code of conduct and hardly ever refer to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That wasnât written back in the 1980s. It was written in 2012 in response to the Finkelstein Report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they did refer to their code of conduct, journalists would frequently come across the phrase: âthe public interestâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, News Corporation Australiaâs admirable code of professional conduct (which doesnât appear in Denisâs appendices but can be found on &lt;em&gt;Media Watch&lt;/em&gt;âs website under the âResourcesâ tag) contains this injunction about privacy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âJournalists have no general right to report the private behaviour of public figures unless public interest issues arise.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denis deals with the issue of public interest extensively in his book. âThe public interestâ, he writes, âis not the same as public curiosity, nor is it assessed by whether a story increases newspaper circulation or generates high levels of online clicksâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well duh! Everyone knows that, Denis, surely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no. In March 2009, Sydneyâs &lt;em&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; and four other News Ltd Sunday tabloids chose to publish pictures on their front pages of a semi-naked young woman who they claimed was an 18-year-old Pauline Hanson. That same day, before it became clear that the pictures were fakes, Media Watch asked the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; what public interest was served by their publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a swift response to our question from Helen McCabe, the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;âs deputy editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âThatâs for our readers to tell. That will be determined by the number of people that buy the paper.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was from the deputy editor of Australiaâs second best-selling Sunday newspaper, and now the editor of Australiaâs top-selling magazine, the &lt;em&gt;Australian Womenâs Weekly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes you realise that for many practising journalists, the ethics of their own profession is â to coin that famous Churchillian phrase â a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. They really donât understand the notion at all. Which is why â if they could be induced to read it â Denis Mullerâs book would prove so useful to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that thatâs especially likely. You have far more experience than I, Denis, of the editorial process in a daily newspaper. But the idea that any editor or reporter â especially when facing the deadlines imposed by the digital age â would apply your amended Potterâs Box in an attempt to resolve a pressing ethical issue strikes me, I have to say, as a bit fanciful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Denis recalls himself from his days at the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt;, daily journalism is a hard-bitten, rough-and-tumble business. You donât get the feeling that Fleet Street news editors have ever encouraged moral scruples when there was a story to be got and the competition was tough. I have never believed that the executive producers of our own most competitive journalistic endeavours â not the tabloid newspapers, but the tabloid television programs &lt;em&gt;This Day Tonight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Current Affair&lt;/em&gt;, which went head to head across the nation every evening for decades â ever troubled themselves deeply about privacy, or accuracy, or the public interest. What dominated their thoughts, morning till night, was ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, competition, and the lack of it, is the chief determinant, in my view, of the ethical standard of journalism in any particular market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Australiaâs tabloid newspapers are, on the whole, more responsible, less cavalier about truth and reputation, than their British equivalents, it is not because our defamation laws are tougher â they are demonstrably not. Itâs not because our proprietors are more caring: most Australian newspapers belong to the same global behemoth as the &lt;em&gt;News of the World&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;. Itâs because the London tabloids compete with each other each morning to sell newspapers across the length and breadth of England and Wales â most of those sales coming not from subscriptions but from direct purchases from newsagents. Australian tabloids, by contrast, have a monopoly, or near-monopoly, in their own city. They can afford to be a little more restrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that was the case, until very recently. But now every tabloid newspaper in the country is in a cut-throat competition for online readers, not just with the erstwhile quality broadsheetsâ websites, which are every bit as tabloid as they are, but with global providers of tits and tattle like the &lt;em&gt;Mail Online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working at the latter organ is, by the sound of it, a searing experience, to use Denis Mullerâs phrase. The pressure to produce huge numbers of stories each day is intense. Usually they are thinly adapted from other news sources â including, to its continuing fury, from News Corp Australia websites. Some reporters have already left the &lt;em&gt;Mail Online&lt;/em&gt;, complaining that there is never time to leave their desks to follow up leads or break genuinely new stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be very surprised indeed if new recruits to the &lt;em&gt;Mail Online&lt;/em&gt; were offered training in the efficks of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least, these days, young reporters are likely to recognise an ethical dilemma when they meet one. Because so many study journalism at universities, where they are introduced to the notion that there are ethical rules, before they confront the brute reality of the newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs as a teaching tool that Denisâs book is likely to be used most. I donât agree with everything in it. But in a comparatively short space it does traverse pretty much all the important ethical questions that confront our profession. Not only that, but it teases out the philosophical and moral principles that will help us to decide how to resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And itâs at its strongest, in my view, when it deals with the issues that confront journalists reporting on traumatic events like the Victorian bushfires. The first-hand research that Denis and Michael Gawenda conducted with bushfire survivors lends a real credibility to the parts of the book that deal with notions such as consent and privacy. They remind us that good journalism can be of real benefit to its subjects as well as to its consumers, just as bad or thoughtless journalism can be damaging far beyond the understanding, often, of its perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I havenât talked to Denis Muller about his view of the Finkelstein report. I know that Meg Simons, the current director of the ACAJ, feels very much as I do â that Finkelstein, with his proposed Media Council, with its potentially draconian powers, enforceable, ultimately, by the courts, wanted to go further than either of us would have gone in trying to force the media to behave ethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Denis did a considerable amount of consulting work for the Finkelstein Inquiry â after a recommendation by Meg, which, according to &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;, constituted an âinterestâ that should have been declared every time she commented on the report â I suspect he shares our view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might surprise &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;, which has rather odd views about media academics, and for that matter about media ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thereâs not much in this book about media law â about what it compels journalists to do â and nothing at all about whether the media should be subject to heavier regulation. What it is about is the need for journalists to take it on themselves to behave ethically, and how they can work out what that means in the infinitely varied scenarios that our jobs throw at us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is terrific, so long as they work for employers who will give them the leeway to act ethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâm one of those who has been extraordinarily fortunate: because Iâve worked for public broadcasters for most of the past 40 years, Iâve been able to make a good living doing journalism that was, in my own estimation at least, important, and responsible, and as true as I could make it. I have very seldom felt that I was acting unethically, and certainly have seldom felt any pressure from my bosses or employers to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my five years in the &lt;em&gt;Media Watch&lt;/em&gt; chair taught me how lucky I was. For every sloppy, or deceptive, or bullying reporter we pinged, there would have been two or three who were simply behaving as their editors would have expected them to behave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thatâs the tough truth, and Iâm afraid; and as the struggle to make a buck grows fiercer, it will get tougher still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denis offers us the Potter Box, but he doesnât suggest how young reporters should deal with the dilemma they are all too likely to face: what my editor wants me to do is wrong. I know it is. Itâs unfair, or exploitative, or a beat-up, or a rip-off of someone elseâs work. But if I refuse to do it, my career will suffer, and itâs tough enough these days to make a living as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I believe, it is consumers, not regulators, who will force editors to think more carefully about how they are expecting their journos to behave. As Denis notes, the days of mainstream media immunity are over. Consumers can hit back, through massive social-media pressure on advertisers, for example, when an issue goes viral. Itâs a rough-and-ready sanction, but unlike the ponderous proceedings of the ACMA or the Press Council, itâs astonishingly swift and can be brutally effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thatâs a thought for another time. Kelvin MacKenzie may think that journalism efficks is all about donning white socks and boarding the train at Colchester. Denis Muller reckons itâs about each of us applying the categorical imperative to our messy and exhilarating profession, and doing, as best we can figure it out, the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives me great pleasure to launch Denis Mullerâs &lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/journalism-ethics-for-the-digital-age/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journalism Ethics for the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Donât go home without a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>***The following is an edited transcript of Jonathan Holmes launching, in trademark erudite fashion, Denis Muller's new book, *[Journalism Ethics for the Digital Age](http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/journalism-ethics-for-the-digital-age/).**

A warning. The following speech is classified as suitable for mature audiences. It contains coarse language.

Andy Coulson, erstwhile editor of *The News of the World*, now serving some 18 months at Her Majestyâs pleasure, was born and brought up in Wickford, Essex.

He began his career at the Basildon Evening Echo. Basildon is also in Essex. 

Essex, of course, is a county that stretches from the eastern fringes of London along the north bank of the Thames to the dismal, marshy shores of the North Sea.

South-East Queensland is famous for its white shoes. Essex, for some reason, has always been famous for white socks, worn by its inhabitants with dark business suits. Put âEssex white socksâ into Google, and one of the entries that comes high in the responses is a blog called *Raedwald*, whose author posted this as recently as 2011:

âIn the days when I used to commute from Suffolk to London, our table of regulars used to carry out a white-sock count as the train drew into the intermediate stations. Manningtree, the first Essex stop, would have a WSC of some 10%, Colchester 25% and Chelmsford 40%.â

Where is all this leading, I hear you ask? Well, itâs leading to Kelvin McKenzie. Unlike Andy Coulson, who never quite made it to Rupert Murdochâs redtop daily, but like Coulsonâs boss, friend and lover, Rebekah Brooks, Mr MacKenzie was the editor of *The Sun*. In fact, until recently overtaken by Ms Brooks, he was probably the most notorious of that newspaperâs editors. He held the job for 13 years, from 1981 to 1994; it was his genius that put flesh on the bones of Rupert Murdochâs instinct: that there was money to be made by appealing to the Alf Garnett, the secret inner fascist, in the British working-class reader. 

One of Kelvinâs most famous bon mots was uttered when some poor sap on *The Sun* chose to include the word âethicsâ in a story.

âWotâs this?â MacKenzie is said to have roared. âEfficks? Efficks? Inât that the place east oâ London where they all wear white fuckin socks?â

What he would have made of a book about journalism efficks which re-introduces us to Hobbes, and Locke, and Rousseau, Kant and Bentham and John Stuart Mill, I shudder to think. âNasty, brutish and short?â, I hear him cry. âThatâs not the life of man prior to the social contract. Thatâs description of the ideal *Sun* headline!â

We do know what Kelvin thought of Lord Justice Levesonâs Inquiry into the Essex â Iâm sorry, that should read âethicsâ â of the press, because he gave his lordship the benefit of his wisdom in a notorious statement to the inquiry.

It began: âSo where is David Cameron today? Where is our great Prime Minister who ordered this ludicrous enquiry?â

MacKenzie continued as he had begun, pouring scorn on the questions he had been requested to answer. No, he didnât check the sources of the stories in his paper, he said. âBasically my view was that if it sounded right, it probably was right and therefore we should lob it in,â he said.

There were plenty of laws already, he said, to deal with wrongdoing at the *News of the World*. The only relevant activity that wasnât already illegal, but should be made so, was arse-kissing of newspaper proprietors by politicians. âDo that and you will have my blessingâ he told Lord Justice Leveson, âand I suspect the blessing from Rupert Murdoch, too.â

Well, do that in Australia and we would make a felon of every prime minister since Gough Whitlam.

But the point is this: around the water-coolers of Fleet Street and Canary Wharf, ethics are not much discussed. British journalists, even more than Australian, are well aware of the constraints imposed by the law â especially the law of defamation. But the idea that a reporter should exercise his or her individual conscience in deciding how, or indeed whether, to put a story in the paper is entirely foreign to the way most papers are run.

And with that cavalier attitude to ethics goes â or used to go â an equally insouciant attitude to readerâs complaints. Denis Muller records in the preface to his book that discovering, on becoming news editor of the *Sydney Morning Herald* in the 1980s, that there were people out there who considered that he and the newspaper were publicly accountable was, and I quote, âa searing experienceâ. Most complainants, he made clear, got short shrift.

As it happens, I became executive producer of *Four Corners* in 1982 â about the same time as Denis got his job as news editor at the *Herald*. I arrived straight from England to take over what we used to grandly call âAustraliaâs premier current affairs programâ.

Being a public broadcaster, we took complaints a mite more seriously than most commercial media did. But, when we received a rabid letter accusing *Four Corners* of being staffed by reds, dedicated to the overthrow of a free Australia, Iâm afraid I assumed it was a joke. To someone who knew the country better, the North Queensland postmark might have warned me to be careful.

Instead, I blithely wrote back a jokey letter than began âDear Comradeâ. I acknowledged that of course he was right, though not many viewers had the acumen to penetrate our admittedly thin cover. We had been working for Moscow for years, I admitted, and fervently believed that the revolution was nigh. And I signed it, âJonathan Holmes, Ãommissar, the Four Corners Socialist Collectiveâ.

A couple of weeks later â this was in the days of snail mail â my boss called me up to his office, and handed me a letter. It was addressed to the general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as it then was. It included photocopies of the original complaint, and of my reply. And it was copied to the chairman of the ABC, to each member of the commission, to the prime minister, the minister for communications, the governor-general, and the premier of every state in the Commonwealth.

My boss explained to me that my little joke had not struck the ABCâs senior management as especially hilarious.

Of course, the worst excesses revealed by the phone-hacking scandal are not commonplace here in Australia. But, as its reaction to the Finkelstein Inquiry made clear, the Australian mainstream media is as loath as ever to acknowledge that it owes much to the Australian public in the way of accountability.

When I was at *Media Watch*, I was frequently invited to give talks and lectures on this topic. I was much given to quoting a passage written by a former editor-in-chief of *The Age*, and the founding director of the Centre for Advanced Journalism, Michael Gawenda:

*It is my experience that editors and journalists are more interested in burying complaints from readers than addressing them â¦ and that most media organisations have wholly inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints by readers, viewers and listeners.*

*I would bet that most journalists on most newspapers â and indeed in most commercial television and radio organisations â could not outline their organisationâs code of conduct and hardly ever refer to it.*

That wasnât written back in the 1980s. It was written in 2012 in response to the Finkelstein Report. 

If they did refer to their code of conduct, journalists would frequently come across the phrase: âthe public interestâ. 

For example, News Corporation Australiaâs admirable code of professional conduct (which doesnât appear in Denisâs appendices but can be found on *Media Watch*âs website under the âResourcesâ tag) contains this injunction about privacy: 

âJournalists have no general right to report the private behaviour of public figures unless public interest issues arise.â

Denis deals with the issue of public interest extensively in his book. âThe public interestâ, he writes, âis not the same as public curiosity, nor is it assessed by whether a story increases newspaper circulation or generates high levels of online clicksâ.

Well duh! Everyone knows that, Denis, surely.

Well, no. In March 2009, Sydneyâs *Sunday Telegraph* and four other News Ltd Sunday tabloids chose to publish pictures on their front pages of a semi-naked young woman who they claimed was an 18-year-old Pauline Hanson. That same day, before it became clear that the pictures were fakes, Media Watch asked the *Sunday Telegraph* what public interest was served by their publication.

We got a swift response to our question from Helen McCabe, the *Sunday Telegraph*âs deputy editor:

âThatâs for our readers to tell. That will be determined by the number of people that buy the paper.â

This was from the deputy editor of Australiaâs second best-selling Sunday newspaper, and now the editor of Australiaâs top-selling magazine, the *Australian Womenâs Weekly*.

It makes you realise that for many practising journalists, the ethics of their own profession is â to coin that famous Churchillian phrase â a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. They really donât understand the notion at all. Which is why â if they could be induced to read it â Denis Mullerâs book would prove so useful to them.

Not that thatâs especially likely. You have far more experience than I, Denis, of the editorial process in a daily newspaper. But the idea that any editor or reporter â especially when facing the deadlines imposed by the digital age â would apply your amended Potterâs Box in an attempt to resolve a pressing ethical issue strikes me, I have to say, as a bit fanciful.

As Denis recalls himself from his days at the *Herald* and the *Age*, daily journalism is a hard-bitten, rough-and-tumble business. You donât get the feeling that Fleet Street news editors have ever encouraged moral scruples when there was a story to be got and the competition was tough. I have never believed that the executive producers of our own most competitive journalistic endeavours â not the tabloid newspapers, but the tabloid television programs *This Day Tonight* and *A Current Affair*, which went head to head across the nation every evening for decades â ever troubled themselves deeply about privacy, or accuracy, or the public interest. What dominated their thoughts, morning till night, was ratings.

Indeed, competition, and the lack of it, is the chief determinant, in my view, of the ethical standard of journalism in any particular market.

If Australiaâs tabloid newspapers are, on the whole, more responsible, less cavalier about truth and reputation, than their British equivalents, it is not because our defamation laws are tougher â they are demonstrably not. Itâs not because our proprietors are more caring: most Australian newspapers belong to the same global behemoth as the *News of the World* and the *Sun*. Itâs because the London tabloids compete with each other each morning to sell newspapers across the length and breadth of England and Wales â most of those sales coming not from subscriptions but from direct purchases from newsagents. Australian tabloids, by contrast, have a monopoly, or near-monopoly, in their own city. They can afford to be a little more restrained.

Or that was the case, until very recently. But now every tabloid newspaper in the country is in a cut-throat competition for online readers, not just with the erstwhile quality broadsheetsâ websites, which are every bit as tabloid as they are, but with global providers of tits and tattle like the *Mail Online*.

Working at the latter organ is, by the sound of it, a searing experience, to use Denis Mullerâs phrase. The pressure to produce huge numbers of stories each day is intense. Usually they are thinly adapted from other news sources â including, to its continuing fury, from News Corp Australia websites. Some reporters have already left the *Mail Online*, complaining that there is never time to leave their desks to follow up leads or break genuinely new stories. 

I would be very surprised indeed if new recruits to the *Mail Online* were offered training in the efficks of journalism. 

But at least, these days, young reporters are likely to recognise an ethical dilemma when they meet one. Because so many study journalism at universities, where they are introduced to the notion that there are ethical rules, before they confront the brute reality of the newsroom.

That might surprise *The Australian*, which has rather odd views about media academics, and for that matter about media ethics.

But thereâs not much in this book about media law â about what it compels journalists to do â and nothing at all about whether the media should be subject to heavier regulation. What it is about is the need for journalists to take it on themselves to behave ethically, and how they can work out what that means in the infinitely varied scenarios that our jobs throw at us.

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to let you know about a debut novel we&amp;rsquo;re publishing later this year: &lt;em&gt;Wolf in White Van&lt;/em&gt;, by John Darnielle. Some of you may already know John as the singer, songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and basically insanely talented guy behind indie-rock darlings, &lt;a href="http://www.mountain-goats.com/"&gt;the Mountain Goats&lt;/a&gt; â and you&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased to know that he&amp;rsquo;s just as incredible on the page as he is in song. And for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t â well, we don&amp;rsquo;t know whether to feel sad that you&amp;rsquo;ve missed out for so long, or be jealous that you get to experience him for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, this book is a big one. Beautifully written and unexpectedly moving, it&amp;rsquo;s a marvel of storytelling brio and genuine literary delicacy, and it will be out in November.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>We're thrilled to let you know about a debut novel we're publishing later this year: *Wolf in White Van*, by John Darnielle. Some of you may already know John as the singer, songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and basically insanely talented guy behind indie-rock darlings, [the Mountain Goats](http://www.mountain-goats.com/) â and you'll be pleased to know that he's just as incredible on the page as he is in song. And for those of you who don't â well, we don't know whether to feel sad that you've missed out for so long, or be jealous that you get to experience him for the first time.

Either way, this book is a big one. Beautifully written and unexpectedly moving, it's a marvel of storytelling brio and genuine literary delicacy, and it will be out in November.</content>

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Scribe has acquired world rights in two novels by Miles Allinson, the Melbourne author whose first novel, &lt;em&gt;Fever of Animals&lt;/em&gt;, won the 2014 Victorian Premier&amp;rsquo;s Literary Award for an Unpublished Manuscript in May this year. &lt;em&gt;Fever of Animals&lt;/em&gt; is a thoughtful and beautifully observed novel about a man trying to make sense of his life through the prism of two overseas journeys heâs taken; one in which his relationship disintegrated, and the other in which he searches for a Romanian surrealist painter who disappeared in a forest in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe acquired the rights at auction from Clare Forster at Curtis Brown. &lt;em&gt;Fever of Animals&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for publication in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scribe publisher Henry Rosenbloom said: &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to be publishing Miles, and to be bringing to Australian and United Kingdom readers a genuinely exciting new literary talent. Miles&amp;rsquo; work is characterised by some of the best writing I have seen in an Australian debut.â&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to David Kilcullen, whose 2013 book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/out-of-the-mountains/"&gt;Out of the Mountains: the coming age of the urban guerilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, has been shortlisted for the Western Australian Premier&amp;rsquo;s Book Awards in the non-fiction category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Kilcullen is one of the worldâs foremost thinkers on counterinsurgency and military strategy. &lt;em&gt;Out of the Mountains&lt;/em&gt; is his third book, and is a fascinating look at the future of warfare, which Kilcullen argues will move away from the remote, rural, guerilla warfare of recent years, and into the coastal cities in which 75% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population will be living by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winners will be announced on 22 September â you can see the full shortlist &lt;a href="http://pba.slwa.wa.gov.au/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve recently acquired &lt;em&gt;The Secret History of Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;staff writer Jill Lepore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leporeâs book tells the story of one of our greatest pop culture icons, as well as revealing the secret life of her highly influential creator and the real heroines who inspired him. Ultimately, she tells the story of womenâs experience in the twentieth century as it has never been told before â from the womenâs suffrage campaigns of the early 1900s to the troubled place of feminism a century later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commanding a vast and passionate following, Wonder Woman has never been out of print in seven decades. She appeared in 1941, a liberated and powerful female superhero at a time when womenâs role models were stiflingly conservative. Her creator was American psychologist William Moulton Marston, who was inspired by legends of the warrior princesses of the Amazon and by early feminists, beginning with the British suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through extensive research, Lepore paints a compelling portrait of Marston, revealing him to have been talented and charismatic, but also deeply conflicted. He wrote a column celebrating conventional family life, but practised extraordinary sexual nonconformity, with his wife and mistress living under the same roof. The inventor of the lie detector, he lived a life of secrets â which he then spilled onto the pages of the Wonder Woman comics he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be publishing &lt;em&gt;The Secret History of Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt; in November â just in time for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Cotton has been the media advisor to three federal cabinet ministers, as well as working extensively as a journalist, and he makes good use of his experience in &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat Bounce&lt;/em&gt;. Set in Canberra, it follows Detective Darren Glass as he races to solve a murder (or three) in the lead-up to a federal election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judges said: âA detailed procedural with a stoic, resourceful and, of course, slightly renegade AFP detective supported by a plucky girl-Friday journo &amp;hellip; explores some interesting what-ifs involving death and kidnapping at the highest levels of Aussie politics.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winners will be announced at the Brisbane Writers Festival on 6 September.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Scribe author Bryan Stevenson, whose book &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; has been shortlisted for &lt;a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/prize/2014/finalists/nonfiction/"&gt;The Kirkus Nonfiction Prize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described by Kirkus as âEmotionally profound, necessary readingâ, &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; is the inspirational true account of a young black lawyer who grew up in a racially segregated community in the South and went on to found the Equal Justice Initiative. Bryan Stevenson and the EJI defend prisoners on death row, including the poor, the mentally ill, and children being tried as adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful, bold true story about the potential for mercy to redeem us, and a clarion call to fix Americaâs broken system of justice â from one of the most brilliant and influential lawyers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be publishing &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; in February 2014. To watch Bryan Stevensonâs TED Talk, click &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/bryan_stevenson_we_need_to_talk_about_an_injustice?language=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content_markup>&lt;p&gt;We have acquired World English rights in &lt;em&gt;Kruso&lt;/em&gt;, by Lutz Seiler, which was awarded the recently announced 2014 German Book Prize â that countryâs equivalent to the Man Booker Prize. Seiler is a multi-award-winning poet and short-story writer. &lt;em&gt;Kruso&lt;/em&gt;, his first novel, has sold over 120,000 copies in Germany since its publication in September. We acquired the rights at auction from Nora Mercurio at Suhrkamp Verlag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kruso is set on a legendary island off the north coast of Germany at the very end of the division of Germany into East and West in 1989. Scribe publisher, Henry Rosenbloom, described it as âa beautiful, poetic, multi-layered novel about friendship, freedom, and adventure, with echoes of Daniel Defoeâs &lt;em&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt;. We are thrilled to have been granted the right to bring this outstanding book to an international English readership.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will publish &lt;em&gt;Kruso&lt;/em&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
